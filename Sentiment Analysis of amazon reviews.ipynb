Leaving aside all the wild inaccuracies - one of the main ones being Auel's portrayal of Neandertals as doltish brutes -the heroine is constantly making one earthshaking discovery after another - shampoo, domestication of animals, law of genetics, sex=pregnancy, and, last but not least, tampax. No one else can figure anything out, but there she is, churning out one Nobel-Laureate discovery after another. I'm sure in one of the later books she will be found making a short-wave radio out of a large rock. It became really maddening.\",\n          \"Disappointing: This is the 4th Clavell book I've read, I was more than a little disappointed. I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it.

I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it.

No one else can figure anything out, but there she is, churning out one Nobel-Laureate discovery after another.

I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it.

It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^',\n"," \"The best soundtrack ever to anything.: I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.\",\n"," 'Amazing!: This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of \"Prisoners of Fate\" (which means all the more if you\\'ve played the game) and the hope in \"A Distant Promise\" and \"Girl who Stole the Star\" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like \"Chrono Cross ~ Time\\'s Scar~\", \"Time of the Dreamwatch\", and \"Chronomantique\" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer\\'s work (I haven\\'t heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can\\'t say for sure), and even if you\\'ve never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.',\n"," \"Excellent Soundtrack: I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music. I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross\",\n"," \"Remember, Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing it: If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper.\",\n"," \"an absolute masterpiece: I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^\",\n"," 'Buyer beware: This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs!

This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a \"lean\" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don\\'t waste your money.

As is often the case she \\'finds\\' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players. With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!',\n"," 'Fashionable Compression Stockings!: After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling.',\n"," \"Jobst UltraSheer Thigh High: Excellent product. However, they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help.\",\n"," 'sizes recomended in the size chart are not real: sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart.

I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix.\",\n"," 'Another Abysmal Digital Copy: Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you\\'ve ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and \\'old home\\' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain\\'s commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film\\'s best presentation is on YOUTUBE.

I don\\'t know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents\\' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers\\' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the \"New Young\" of Japan seem to be creating an \"international\" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family.

In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold.

Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual.

The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated movie \"Glitter\" starring Mariah Carey). The show could make for a great drama series, but I felt that it is a mix of a drama, comedy, and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show. The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn\\'t get around to seeing it. I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great. The season finale was an interesting to watch.The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988.

It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now.

The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like \"The School for Scandal\" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn\\'t ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what?

The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed.

He seemed tasked with the burden of playing a man who was apathetic, but he came across as being apathetic about the role.

It was occasionally funny, considering the title and cast of comedians, who played comedians. The last 45 minutes, the film changes pace entirely, as if it wasn't floundering enough, and drops its attempts at weak comedy to push even weaker drama.

George re-examines his life, but even at mid-life he is still an immature a-hole. Everyone has sex but Ira, which seems to be a sad joke.I found the jokes and humor to be at best, lame.

Funny People starts with promise as a Jim Carrey Man on the Moon type film and then drifts oddly into some sort of romantic comedy with repetitive c**k jokes.

I was not disappointed! I think everyone will love this illustrated novel.Jorma\",\n"," \"A wonderful, funny-sad book: The Rabbi's Cat is a wonderful book. I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book. Of course, the book is so appropriate for the cat lover. The author clearly understands cats perfectly.\",\n"," \"good artwork too!: The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs.\",\n"," 'Delightful, exotic world seen through a cat\\'s eyes: \"The Rabbi\\'s Cat,\" by French artist and filmmaker Joann Sfar, is a whimsical, charming fable featuring a rabbi, his lovely daughter, and a host of other characters headed by a talking cat. Both protagonist and narrator, the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments, often sardonically, on the actions of the humans around him. Set in pre-World War II Algeria, with a lengthy detour to Paris, the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural, social and religious backgrounds. In this multilayered environment, the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place.',\n"," \"Self-Serving Message: This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children.\",\n"," \"Not what it looks like on the cover.: As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts.

Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me.

Economics is a Science, and it is better to put away your Political Glasses when studying it.\",\n"," 'ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON: Economics in One Lesson is another great \"must read\" book. Like Bastiat\\'s \"The Law,\" it is short and sweet. At the same time, it clearly explains the basic fundamentals of economics.Considering the stupid and abusive actions that are rampant in Congress, state legislatures, county commissions and city councils, the overwhelming majority of these so-called \\'leaders\\' are utterly ignorant.Don\\'t you be one of them.Buy and read Economics in One Lesson.Then call up your politicians and give them an earful.',\n"," 'Never more needed than today: Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public.The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and \"higher education\" without learning the first thing about economic science (while getting bombarded with self-serving economic propaganda). Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then, while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased.Here\\'s a revolutionary fantasy: Make this book a required study by all high school students. Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future.BTW, you can get the nice hard-cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute.',\n"," 'Economics even you will Understand: For all who avoided economics like the plague, this is the book for you.very informative, and gives the novice a good foundation of the subject... Check it out.. next time you argue economics with uncle Fred, you wont sound like such a dope',\n"," 'Simply brilliant!: This is a great start to learning Austrian economics, or rather, any kind of economics. All members of Congress should be required to read this before being allowed to vote on any bills. Peter Schiff\\'s \"Crashproof\" would be a great followup to reading Economics in One Lesson. And for the more serious student of Austrian economics, especially in these times, you should read von Mises Theory of Money and Credit, and Rothbard\\'s The Great Depression.',\n"," \"One lesson that EVERYONE needs to learn!: As a student and teacher of economics, this book has proved to be an invaluable resource! The lesson is simple and direct, yet one that many people fail to apply. This should be required reqding for anyone involved in the development of economic policy (or any other arm of policy making, for that matter). Whether you agree with Hazlitt's conclusions about how the market works or not, you cannot dispute the key lesson of this book. It is entertaining to read, particularly easy for a book about economics. I highly recommend it!\",\n"," \"Textbook: Should have been a nationwide elementary school textbook for the past 60 years.Upon reading this book, and knowing your fellow Americans will have, one couldn'timagine the losses of freedom that we are experiencing now.

I learned a lot from this book without feeling like I had to muddle through it. I benefitted from taking micro and macro before reading, but it's not necessary, and anyone interested in learning about how special interests kill the consumer and taxpayer because their well-being is easier to measure and is effected more immediately (aka every modern economic issue) has an obligation to read this book.\",\n"," \"Painful: I wouldn't recommend this book to an enemy. True, the information may be worthy, but the writing style and the narration were horrible. It is definitely NOT written (nor read) in a conversational manner. I'm willing to cut the narrator some slack as he was only reading what was written, however better inflection, phrasing, pauses, etc... would have greatly helped this otherwise tedious book.I couldn't even finish it. I suffered through the first 5 disks and after all that investment in time I couldn't bring myself to listen to the 6th.

I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's.\",\n"," \"Don't Be Fooled By the Title of This Book: The only economic lessons in it are a very biased critique of any economic policy other than capitalist doctrine. I wanted to learn about economics and was so disappointed in this outdated, one-sided book.\",\n"," 'Hypocritical, Biased, outdated and misleading: This book opens with the author explaining his objective analysis of popular fallacies within economics. In no way is this book objective, it is not so much a introduction to economics than a book with a political agenda. He rarely shows two sides of the arguement, spins fact real well all the while omitting valuable information contrary to his veiws. DONT READ THIS AS YOUR FIRST ECONOMICS BOOK, and if you do read it, take it with a grain of salt.',\n"," \"Capitalism straight, in small unpalatable doses: If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing .

The author believes that unchecked corporate power will liberate the economy and, therefore, humanity.Hazlitt is obviously a corporate apologists who refuses to scrutinize the \"successes\" of liberalized trade policies throughout the world. A look at any number of third world countries will reveal the true outcome of relinquishing government and social controls of the economy.',\n"," 'ASTOUNDING: It is astounding that anyone in this age can seriously recommend this book. It has no bearing on the world economy and is blatantly anti labor and anti government regulation. It is hopelessly out of date.',\n"," \"how to fail economics 101: This book preaches a very right wing kind of economics.

As it is avaiable free on Limewire, maybe get a free copy on the Net or browse it in your local library. No need to buy unless you want to flesh out (sic) the ideas of Mr Limbaugh et al.

It is amazing to me that a book written in 1946 is still so fundamentally relevant.',\n"," \"A great alternative perspective: Particularly appropriate for these times (even many decades after it was written), Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson offers an alternative to the traditional Keynesian economic theory of the 20th Century. This book is a fairly easy read for non-economists and, though a bit repetitive towards the end, quite enlightening. I'd recommend this book strongly for any student of macro economics or anyone curious in what is happening to the global economy.\",\n"," 'Sanity in Economics: This is economic sanity. Easy to understand. If more people and especially those in government would read this book, we would be better off.',\n"," 'Fine Summary: This is a great primer that should be read in all schools. Hazlitt does not deal in economic details here. Intead, Economics in One Lesson covers more useful ground for the average person: it cumulatively teaches us how to think logically about economic issues. And, of course, how you think is the basis for what you think. Even the casual reader will take away an ability to spot economic silliness, many of which spring from the same bad premises, the same elementary blindness to cause-and-effect. Economics in One Lesson provides the type of knowledge that stays with you for a lifetime.',\n"," \"A good libertarian primer: This book is a little outdated, and a little heavy on the libertarianism, but otherwise it's a very easy read, and I particularly like some of the stories it uses to present basic economic ideas.\",\n"," 'Important: Just under two hundred pages, I learned more from this short book on Economics than from three entire textbooks in College. Concise, well worded and simplified reality. Anyone wanting to understand the market system and how it works can gain greatly by reading Hazlitt.',\n"," 'Economics: Very clearly written with a minimum of jargon. Basic principles easy to understand even for the non-economist, but topics were not oversimplified. Essential reading for anyone who wants to make informed decisions in these troubled economic times.',\n"," \"Frighteningly Prophetic: An easy to understand overview of economics and, when considering the condition we are in today, scary! It explains a great deal about our current economic problems though originally written in the 40's.\",\n"," 'Great book: This is a great introduction to economic analysis. It is very well written and the examples are still surprisingly current.Bad economic thinking plagues the political and mediatic scene. Hazlitt focuses his effort on a key mistake, that of ignoring the unseen possibilities (or opportunity cost).',\n"," 'Great summary of some very difficult economic principles: This was my first experience reading Hazlitt and it won\\'t be my last. He has an \"Adam Smith\" way of writing (whether intentional or not, who\\'s to tell) and everytime I wanted to compare this book to Wealth of Nations, I quickly curbed my enthusiasm. This is a good book, not great and I\\'m not quite sure why all the great reviews. I do like his way of explaining some very difficult economic ideas and I can see this book being a valuable introduction to economic principles, maybe not economics 101.

Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book.

You can get it online for free.',\n"," \"More politics, less economincs: I wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view.

The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase.\",\n"," \"Seriously Flawed: Bottom line, there are some serious flaws in the author's thinking. For example, in chapter 11 (Tariffs), the author argues that imposing a $5 tariff on an import (sweaters from England) ends up costing the US. Never once does he add the $5 duty received into the equation. How can someone argue against an import tax without analyzing what happens to the revenues from that tax? When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports, I quit reading.In short, I couldn't agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costs/benefits focus is too narrow. Yet, in trying to expanding the analysis beyond the 'too narrow', the author's analysis in fact is often too narrow.\",\n"," 'Not a primer, way too political: Going to be brief here: If you are looking for an introductory to economics, begin your search elsewhere.

The plot is silly. The dialogue is written to tell the reader what's going on (and every character speaks with the same voice) - this isn't how real people speak. Then the characters overexplain because, apparently, the author wasn't paying attention when he gave you the same information a dozen or so pages ago.Frankly, I've read enough about the IRA and Prods and One Para and County Down to last me the rest of my born days.

Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot.Nonetheless, the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic. The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins, and how honesty, for some, comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience, but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes, and less exposition, it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition, which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations, which capture the essence and the mood of the novel.

The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society, is especially moving. While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid, most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study, though at times it's little slow.Overall, a well-crafted story and a good read.The book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents.

He goes on and on stating irrelevant details and fills page after page with unnecessary imagery. These pages consist of long paragraphs, some which encompass multiple pages. If I didn't have to read this for class I definitely would not have read it on my own. I'm not saying that it is a difficult novel, but it is an unpleasant one.

Now that the baby is 3 months old, they have her stand in the center of town with so she can be shamed by the whole town. Her husband just happens to come to town as she stands on the scaffold and thus the story continues in a dark spiral of hidden friendships, revenge, immense guilt, and sin.

Not only is the character developmet quite thorough and enjoyable but it gives us a glimpse of the society in which it was written.

Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings, even though they are doing the best they can to raise their child(ren) and to survive themselves.

The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature, hypocrisy, and of undeniable passions.Enlightening and refreshing, the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately, beyond the limits that society sets.

I found the book itself to be challenging to read, but I liked the story. Hawthorne explores when feelings and passion conflict with religion, which was fascinating to consider from a religious perspective.Although I did not enjoy the book much at the time I had to read it, it proved to be quite useful when I took the AP Literature and Composition Test this year.

Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock. Since she won\\'t reveal the identity of the father, she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter \"A\" on her chest for the rest of her life. She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around, so at the end of the book, people refer to her as \"Angel\" instead of \"Adulterer.\"This is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period. When we do something wrong, the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character. One event does not define us. It\\'s our entire lives that should be taken into account. I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne\\'s point. Redemption is possible for anyone, regardless of their sin. Also, the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader, suffers enormously because he doesn\\'t confess. This is a good point. When we hide our sins, the only person it ultimately hurts, is us.',\n"," \"One of the Greatest Books Ever Written: The Scarlet Letter is an excellent book. Hawthorne spends so much time discussing the characters' thoughts and motives that by the end of the book, you can understand why the people act the way they do. It makes them seem almost real. He relates nature to what the character's are experiencing that makes the story even more powerful. In one place he told of a rose bush that grew by the prison so it seemed Nature was saying that even though other people had abandoned them, someone could always count on the nature's love. It's very beautifully written. The story of adultery and jealous spouses happens in our own day which makes The Scarlet Letter relate to the reader.

Emmanuelle Beart, looking like a wood nymph, is beautiful as Jean's daughter, bent on revenge, and Daniel Auteuil as the lovesick man who's past comes back to haunt him is terrific.Yves Montand is magnificent. This is one of his greatest performances, and shouldn't be missed. His scene with the blind woman is so memorable. I think about that scene often, and of how easy it is to make life changing mistakes by misunderstanding circumstances.The soundtrack by Jean-Claude Petit is lovely, using a theme from Verdi's \"La Forza del Destino\" as its main melody, and the cinematography superb. Best of all, the ending is perfection. Satisfying. A work of art completed.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: great finish: Well done, a bit of a fairy tale ending whereby all the loose ends seem to be tied up, not as poetic as the first part, \"Jean de Florette\", but the surprises and the lessons about what makes life really worthwhile are still very powerful!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Manon censored!? You gotta be kidding.: A note of caution regarding this great and classic film: do NOT buy the censored Korean import dvd under any circumstances.

Rather than spend your time trying to figure out why Ugolin is crazed by what he sees (though we don't), find a copy of the uncensored, original MGM version or wait for Criterion to release it. BTW, my rating applies only to the Korean import, other versions (dvd or vhs) get five stars.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Manon censored!?

Good Luck Arizona Man is the story of a white boy raised by Apaches, trying to discover the secrets of his own past and heritage while keeping his Apache identity. He goes on a search for the lost gold of the Apaches, which is tied up with his own mystery. Unfortunately, the mountains are filled with bizarre and dangerous white men also searching for the gold: and the Apache chief has sent men to ensure that the prophesy (he who finds the gold must die) comes trueThe book is humorous and whimsical, with many surprising plot twists. I doubt that the portrait of Apache life and customs is very accurate, but the white men are equally ridiculous. In any case, the characters (and their names--Head Toter, Tied-Up, Miss Utter Delight, Fantail and Poop, Old Wickiup, Missing Toe) are hilarious and unforgettable.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Won't work in Dimage 7i: Inserting this card in my new Minolta Dimage 7i (digital camera), I get an \"Unable to use card\" error.

I don't know where that data came from, but in independant photo review sites, this SimpleTech card screams. No other brand was faster. By the way, no brand has ever tested in Camera's that even came close to 8000 kb/s or above.Most CF cards test in at around 2000 Kb/s, some well known brands(SanDisk and Lexar) are at 800kb/s not 8000!!!! If you really want the truth, no card does well in Nikon's. They read at one bit, other cameras,Canon, Minolta etc read with 4 bits, are more advanced and produce superior results with both read and write speeds.

The author seems to shove her opinion down your throat that all the cares in the world would be solved if people were to stay stoned as much as possible.

It follows the lives of a family that deals with wars, tragic love, and mysterious dealings. I thorougly enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to enter a magical world filled with vibrant characters taking on all sorts of political and social issues to heart and then bending them as far as they can go. Think Dali.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: For Lovers of Latin American Literature: I was pleasantly surprised to find this on Oprah's list. I read this book in college and it was my first exposure to magic realism. Such imaginative narrative is hard to come by and who could forget such events as the discovery of a dead angel, the whole town suffering from insomnia, or the beautiful Remedios (one of many)ascending to heaven? Just as a sidenote I find one of the characters toward the end is disturbingly like Michael Jackson with his lifestyle of decadence and his penchant for the company of little boys. It's a book that is very sensual and colorful, I would love to see it transferred successfully to film. But this book is not for anyone. Just for those who love truly imaginative literature.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Naptime: Horrible! Boring and could not keep my interest.

They said it would explain the culture and tell the story of Colombia. After visiting Colombia and immersing myself in the culture and history of this incredible country, I do not see the fit. Colombia is a country with energy, action and forward momentum rather than a sleepy melancholy society chasing its tail.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.95)\n","\n","Review: Middle of the Road: My experience with 100 Years of Solitude has been that people either love it or they absolutely hate it, but I'm apathetic about it. I had to read it for a world cultures class in college and not even the teacher could tell us how it was relevant to what the class was about. The repetition of the men's names makes for a very confusing story line, and the son that was born with a tail? Weird, to say the least. But apparently this book inspires a lot of people judging by the previous reviews. I would suggest that you read it if for no other reason than to form your own opinion about it.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: pointless: I enjoyed the first hundred pages or so.

Asphyxiation.: In what appears to be a stab at Western values this Prize winning author has created a confusing mess.Many people take this book and wade through it seeking some sort of enlightenment from such a prestigious work (Nobel Prize 1982). When, in reality, this book is a sophomoric slap at US and Western European anti-communist policies of the Cold War.I am not saying the Western policies were sound, but I will say that communism and the system it supported have been proven to be morally bankrupt and fiscally unsound. Perhaps the politics of the time pushed the Nobel Committee into giving an award that could have been given elsewhere.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Huh?: What is the point of this book? It doesn't have one, in my opinion. The author himself said that the reason for writing it was that he wanted to write a book about incest! I really do not enjoy graphic descriptions of this incest, either. I would not reccommend it to anyone, in fact, I tell others NOT to read it. I wouldn't have read past the tenth page if I hadn't been required to for my English class.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A timeless classic: The One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of the most interesting novel I have ever read. First it starts with a married couple who are counsins, afraid that they will have a child with a pig tail, a myth about what happens when you marry close relations. This novel has the most confusing set of characters with the same name carried on from generation to generation. And this novel has some of the most interesting events that you will ever read. As you read this novel, you can actually see each charactrer falling into their life of solitude, one by one.This novel is very good, and I highly recommend it.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: The worst book ever: When reading is a chore and makes absolutely no sense at all, what is the point? I could not have made it through this book at all without the family tree in the front since so many of the characters have the same or similar names. I read on and on thinking it was going to all start making some sense or there would be a big ending, but in the end I put it down and felt like it was a huge waste of my valuable reading time. I re-sold the book as fast as I could unload it. It is really interesting and amazing to me how so many people love this book....I'm a reader in general but this one I just don't quite grasp. It is a nightmare of a read.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Maybe I just don't get it: Not sure why this book has been so raved about. When I bought it, the book store clerk told me it was his \"favorite book ever\". That's quite an endorsement.I found it to be really uninteresting. It's almost all exposition, with little dialogue. The characters may be \"memorable\", but only because they're \"boring\". None of them have any personality (although one is well-endowed, which is nice) and is the author just *trying* to be difficult when he gives them all such similar names?This book felt like the authors parents told him lots of stories and fables when he was growing up, and he tried to cram them all into one long stream on consciousness tale. I abandoned it half-way through.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Started out good..: I read this book before it became an Oprah pick- and was almost appalled that she had chosen it as something she deemed worthy for others to spend their precious time reading! It started out good to me, I didn't mind the magic realism. I actually thought it was quite charming. But after awhile it seemed that the story just went on, and on, and on... with no real end in sight. Most of the book just seemed kind of like page fillers to me,with no real significance to the story. I was ready to put the book down before I got even half way through, but forced myself to trudge through it to the bitter end. As far as recommendations go, I would recommend passing on this book- or at least borrowing it from a devoted Oprah book club reader. Don't spend your money on it.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Yawn.: Characters aren't interesting. The story is not compelling. The plot is not engaging.

However, I found the book extremely hard to follow, and without any identifyable plot line. Yes, it is interesting to see how a city can develop over 100 years of time, but all the characters kept dying off, and I found myself not being bothered by it, as nothing made me connect with them through the book.

I kept waiting for the story to generate even a spark of interest but it just never happened for me. Admittedly Marquez is a gifted writer and for this reason I was tempted to award the book 2 stars, but if I had to sum up the book in one word it would be PAINFUL, thus the single star. I've read a number of 'classics' which were difficult reads, but there were usually rewards for the effort. I can't say the same for this book.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Absolutely Awful: I was very excited to read this book, and plunged right in when it arrived. As I continued to read, waiting for the plot to kick in, or for something to persuade me to keep reading, I realized the moment would never come. This book represents some of the worst writing I have ever encountered, and it seemed like Marquez was trying too hard to sound poetic. Oh, and after hanging on to witness the full plot, I discovered that there really isn't one. I would not recommend this book to anyone because it is a complete waste of time-- so don't be fooled by people who claim this book is beautiful, like I did.

The same members of the family are reborn in theArcadia family, reincarnated as the 100 years passby. The forces compelling them to act as theydo, attract and repel you at the same time.

Nonetheless, this novel is a lot less confusing in style than, let's say The Autumn of the Patriarch by the same writer or \"Christ versus Arizona\" by Camilo Jose Cela. Indeed, it's easy to get tangled in so many Jose Arcadios and Aurelianos, but this is really a great story. His finesse, the metaphors and symbols he uses, the images the paints, all those lonely souls that inhabit this book, even the absurd that is to be found in this book, all of them combine together and form something really great. Something that is worth your time.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A complete literacy masterpiece!: A complete literacy masterpiece! I had been meaning to read 100 years of solitude for over 7 years but never found the time to do so until now and the book did not disappoint! Gabriel Garcia Marquez painted a whole society with his beautiful breathtaking descriptions of the town Mocondo. I loved the characters from the Buendia family and other fond myself laughing and other times pausing to contemplate his points on life through the actions of some of the characters. There is a little of everything for everyone in this book!

Only in the final pages does it become clear that all which has transpired over the generations was foretold as the rise and fall of the Buendia family by the mystical gypsy Maquiliades. I suspect this literary masterpiece is more impressive in its original Spanish version, but its constant surprises and matter of fact style compel the reader's attention.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Not impressed: I am sorry to say that I gave up on the book. I tried and even read some very intellectually capable folks reviews to see if I was missing something. I came to the conclusion that an individual who rarely reads fiction and who is an engineer by training could probably never \"get\" something like this book. It almost seems that the technique of the writer fascinates many of the readers perhaps more than the substance. The magical realism style is too much for me.

Finally it made sense to me and I've now read it several times and will read it many more.

I really enjoyed it, tho it took me 3 weeks to read it. Everytime I opened it back up to continue where I was I felt like I was stepping back into Macondo. There's no place like it nor is there a family like the Buendia's either. The story and the words used by Marquez are so deep in meaning and a sentence can mean so many things. I loved it and I love the twists and turns the family goes thru like any family. However, I knew what was going to happen in the end, which was really kinda ironic and funny. You have to read to find out.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Fascinating but confusing: One Hundred Years of Solitude chronicles 100 years of a family (of Buendia) and a village (city) that the \"first of the family line\" founded. The prose is lyrical and flows as smoothly as a river. That is, sometimes there are rapids and other times calm. The genre is magical realism, and it is fascinating watching the magic evolve with the family and village. After finishing this book, I'm not 100% certain what Marquez meant by it, though. It has anti-war and anti-oppressive-regime themes, but there's something more that I haven't quite put my finger on yet. I may need to re-read it after letting it settle for a while.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Not for the impatient or inattentive: I bought this book despite the few negative reviews I read about it and was glad that I read it!Sure, everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and previous reviews were right about it not being a book everyone will necessarily like, but if you have patience and a good memory, you will enjoy this book!Yes, it gets confusing because the same names get used throughout the whole book for different generations in the family, but it all ties in to the overall story, which, I thought, only made the story better. You don't see many books like this one, so it's definitely worth a try =).\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Perfect: This is the definition of literature. Years from now, when this age in art history is named Magic Realism or something like that, this book will be its definition. I dare a serious, mature reader to pick this book up and not at least admire the writing. And the ending is something else altogether. Garcia-Marquez leaves the reader to ponder it. I promise that if you pick it up, finish it, and think about it, you will realize that it has the most wonderful, important, and intelligent endings ever written. The realization of it for the reader is almost overpowering. I'm only 17, and I know I will read this book many more times in my life.

It is not really all that long, never dull, and clearer than the most transparent crystal (although, taken at a deeper level, the book offers much more than what appears on the surface). In many respects, the book tells of the rise of, and predicts the fall of, humankind. In this sense, it is allegorical fiction at its finest. Along the way, it tells a cornucopia of stories about love, war, peace, remembrance, time, joy, pain, and many other emotions beyond description in this small amount of space.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Written with the intent to CAPTIVATE !!: One of the few books of AP English that I actually finished, this book held me spellbound. It created that thirst that took over 400 pages to satisfy.desc I've read the reviews of others on this site, and most either loved it or hated it. (Which is the usual responce when a book this amazing is written.) The slow, destined, circular descent of the Buendia family promoted the view that time does not travel in a straight line, but twists and turns and repeats itself. The family represents mankind (i think), and many of the occurences and metaphors of the story remind the reader of historical and psychological truths. And the little tidbits of \"whaat!\" kept the book light-hearted and fun to read, as all 400 page books should be. Those who didnt like it probably mis-directed their attention, avoided the depth but critiqued the purposely shallow ends of the book. In conclusion, a beautiful read, definitly should be required reading for all of humanity!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Opens up worlds: Unfortunately for Marquez, this is the title that is most loved.

It wasn't until college and when I read Garcia Marquez's 100 Years -- that the American novel took on a new and wonderful meaning. A work vibrant and unique, with undertones of the old world, but one still wholly and distinctly a creation of this side of the world. 100 Years is as impressive as Moby Dick, Gatsby, Huck Finn -- and a novel of uncommon beauty, vision, and style\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A Fantastic Story: 100 Years of Solitude is an amazing story where reality and fantasy meet in the lives of the Buendias.

Every sentence reads like poetry and soon you are entranced, finding yourself drifting dazily into the town of Macondo, and imagining hanging your cot with the rest of the Buendia family. I have read this book three times, and notice new glimpses of Marquez's genius each time. And if the lyrical passages and poetic descriptions aren't enough, there is lots of sex, war, jealousy, violence, passion and love.

This seems like a great story!\" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery!

A lot happens in this book, with deaths and spirits and insomnia and marriages, and it's all fairly easy enough to figure out what's going on. Yet, nothing happens. So much plot takes place that the characterization suffers. I simply didn't care what happened to the characters, or anyone in the town. If a bomb had levelled Macondo, I would have simply flipped to the next page to see what happened next, not to read on about the characters. If you're interested in a classic worthy of its praise, where characterization is king, do yourself a favor and pick up Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner. You'll work to read, but your mind and soul will be enriched. Faulkner's novels are like movies you watch in slow motion to get every nuance. Marquez, on the other hand, is like a movie you watch in fast forward.

His skill is like that of a mythical creature, like a Phoenix combined with a hundred great authors.The pure fact that this book was written by one man is amazing. I don't want to say anything about the story. If you care about great literature, do not let life pass by without reading Marquez' masterpiece.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: 100 years of slow reading: This highly overrated book indicates the havoc that overweight talk show hosts can wreak upon the literary world. Garcia's most juvenile and frustrating book is now being yammered about by book clubs the world over who suddenly think they know about South American authors.The book is overly long and repetitive; themes are repeated ad nauseum. Characters (some of whom have the same name) are one dimensional and unbelievable. By the time you reach the halfway point in the book you are praying for something different to happen. Then Garcia introduces a new character, has him act just like all the others, and die within 3 pages. It's amazing how quickly he mows down his creations, as if he is as tired of them as I was.In the end there are no surprises, and you feel exhausted from the repetition. Underwhelming, and nowhere near as good as \"Love in the Time of Cholera\".Give it a miss and try \"Blindness\" instead.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: big disappointment: I bought this book four years ago and finally forced myself to read it from cover to cover. I can't believe all the \"5 star\" reviews people are giving it. This book was one big disappointment and has been exiled to the bottom shelf in my collection.

What a wonderful story full of imagination, sorrow, laughter, solitude, and reality in the same time. How the wars changed the mentality of people, change their behavior, traditions, and it makes them lose the respect for any human relation. How the founded city went from being the most simple, and peaceful place, to this horrifying, deserted city that the technologies ran through it, and its own people stopped caring about what's best for it.How being solitary was the response to many answers, how the Buendia men acted to their defeats, to their pleasures, and how far did they go in order to explore what was out there.The story could be slow at times, but the end has its own unique twist that shows how important history is, and how sad it is when we waste time not doing what we always dreamt of.Such a classic worth reading by Marquez, what dreams, deaths, madness, war, and what pressure has this life on us.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: GET YOUR SLEEPING BAGS READY!: CUZ THIS BOOK IS A \"SNOOZE FEST!\"ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE IS RIGHT CUZ THAT'S HOW MUCH TIME YOU'LL NEED IF YOU EVER WANNA FINISH THIS!I HIGHLY DOUBT OPRAH MADE IT PAST CHAPTER ONE.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.94)\n","\n","Review: Magical Realism at its best: I guess that is where this book is usually categorized in. Apparently, Gabriel Garcia Marquez popularized the genre. I loved the book and would put it in the top five of my list. There are people who I've talked to that thinks it was confusing or complicated. That was not the case for me. It's true that there were many characters (and it does not help that a lot of them are named similarly). But, I think each of them is distinct and was developed very well. The book is not about the town of Macondo...it's about the people who lived there. And, you will be able to relate to the book because of its very human characters set in an environment that is often very real but occasionally eerily surreal. That's magical realism for you.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Among My Most Common Recommendations: As an author with my debut novel in its initial release and an educator in an impoverished border-area high school with a student population usually 99% Latino, I can safely say that Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is among the most common book recommendations I make to my most gifted students. ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE rests near the top of last century's literary works. It is the perfect example of magical realism, and it practically introduced Latin American literature to the world scene. This book is tops. If you haven't read it, do!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A Qualifier: There appears to be a good many who support this book, but none that actually ilustrates explicitly its hidden gem or genius, if there is indeed any. personally i don't see why it's so fantastic. the suspension of fixed parameters and a \"realistic\" framework in general seems to be an easy way to avoid the more prosaic elements and ensuing entanglements in life, and may also be construed as a rather cheap method to beguile readers into a seeming style and artistry.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Not for chickens: This book is not for those who only loved the Chicken Soup for the Soul series. No, this one's for the strong individual. If you have trouble living outside the block - don't touch this one. This one will take you through a journey, with a family through a period of hundred years. The characters are real,raw,blooded,bold,beautiful-people as they should've been before the great civilizations marred our brains with less significant worries. This one is a fantasy with characters you're only dreamed of , if ever. I would recommend it to those who have done a great deal of reading already and not someone checking out on some classics.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: An exceptional book; Beautiful!: There is so much about this book to comment on that it is better for me to keep my comments simple. Yes, it is a difficult book to read and many times I felt myself very confused over who was who and about what was going on. I suppose if you are someone who doesn't want a challenge and you want things very clear and uncomplicated, then this book may not be for you. However, the magical realism does not take away from the absolute beauty and emotion of this book. After reading the book I was in awe of how anyone's writing could be so complicated and so beautiful! I honestly think it is one of the best books ever written and I have read a ton of books! I recently purchased Marquez's newest book (I believe it is his autobiography?) and cannot wait to read it.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: I can't think of a good title at all: The negative reviewers here seem, more or less, to want this book to move faster, or get to some kind of specific point, and are upset that it doesn't. So I'll make this suggestion, if you are reading to get to the end of a book, don't read this book; you won't deserve it. Read a Michael Chrichton book or something. On the other hand, if you are willing to be swept into an epic story that is written (and translated) with style and grace, plotted with a mature sense of wonder, and will make you weep, laugh, and seethe with anger, then read this one.No matter how many times I reach the last page of this book, I never feel like I've \"finished\" it. it always pulls me right back into it.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Enough is Enough: Just recently, I decided to give this book a second chance. Like other reviewers here, I hardly ever give up on a book. But about 30 pages into the SECOND attempt, I am feeling exhausted. All of the bright and shiny books on my bookshelves have never looked so good at this point. So I came here, read the reviews and feel better. I think I can put this book away and be at peace with not appreciating it. I will say, some of the words Marquez uses- his descriptions, seem to have been created especially for the world that exists within this book. But is the trip worth it? I have decided that it is not. Thank you all for helping me be at peace with NOT completing this novel.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.96)\n","\n","Review: Nobel Prize?: So if the Nobel Prize is for the author's body of work then again it does not say much about his work because his most famous work (100 years of solitude) is CRAP (that's in capital letters).

It is nearly impossible to keep track of all the characters. It may take you a little while to become completely imersed in the story, it starts out a little slow. But, it will be well worth it to keep going.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Still reading, but definitely a keeper: This is a classic that I've heard so much about.

That's what truly great literature can do; transcend its status and color a person's view of the world like some life changing event, a birth or a death.Clearly I have personal feelings towards this book, but, to put it simply, this is the novel that made me love literature. In the past I appreciated good writing. I had my degree in English, was prepared to throw down over Moby Dick as needed, but I never loved literature until I discovered the Buendia's and Macondo.What I had been missing was what so many modern writers fail to get across-the mystery of life. Garcia-Marquez solves no riddles and answers no questions. In fact, he doesn't really ask any questions. That's not why he writes. On the contrary, Garcia-Marquez is just a simple storyteller, plying his trade, lolling around in the melodrama of life.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Magical Blend: Gabriel Garcia Marquez weaves a story of a hundred years of love, lust, tumult and downfall in this chronicle of the rise and fall of the Buendia family and the settlement of Macondo. His lyrical prose makes family curses, fortune-tellers, magic carpets and levitation as real and alive as civil wars, passionate and reckless men and women, and banana company plantations. Foolhardy and powerful men, their wives, and mistresses match the tempestousness of the times as they contribute to the fated doom of the family. Marquez creates an atmosphere of languid fatality where old men and women do and undo their chores in an unending spiral till death relives them from their solitude.The translation by Gregory Rabassa preserves the musical qualities of the original langugage.Certainly among the finest novels of the 20th Century.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Oprahs may be the devil...: But dont let that stop you from reading this book. This is the a must read for everyone. As I finished the last page of this book, I flipped it over and started it again. Mr. Marquez takes literature to a new level. This book is seriously clowning on a lot of other recommended and required books throughout history. To not read this book, is to not ever truly experience a great story. Whatever sad excuse for a book you are reading put it down and pick this up. You will never forgive yourself if you dont.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.66)\n","\n","Review: Thank goodness...: ... that Oprah chose this book for her Book Club. Because, you know, that Nobel Prize endorsement is just so overdone.

It was a struggle at times, though. But I would recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their streams of consciousness. I suppose if anything positive may be said about the Oprah Book Club, it's that it at least encourages people to read GGM's work.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Some of the best writing ever: I wish I were more proficient in Spanish so as to be able to read this novel as GGM put it to paper. I can't even begin to compare the prose, the images invoked, to any other writer I've been exposed to; they just don't compare to Marquez. I'm reading it for the 4th or 5th time and can't put it down. The words just seamlessly fall into place in snyc with my thoughts and imagination. That part of this novel is a wonderous experience. As to the content, the Buendias are a family I've become familiar with and increasingly revolted by. Behind all of Marquez's dense fog of magical prose is the sick reality of this family. I understand the intent, but didn't really pay it any attention until the 2nd reading or so. It's animalistic, barbaric, incestuous, and callous; it's a fairly tale on heroin. If you enjoy the style and prose this will be one of your favorite books, but you'll only know if it clicks with you if you give it a try.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: One of my all-time favorites!: The first time I finished this book, I tried to tell all my friends and family members about the story, but could not find the words.

Marquez may be a skilled writer and storyteller, but this book confused, bored and frustrated me without offering entertainment or insight.So what if Oprah picked it and if it has been labled a classic...it is not enjoyable or remarkable to me.

It is too bad you can't sit around a fire listening to his stories instead. This book basically has no overall plot, but many smaller plots for each little story within it. I thought the sheer number of characters who names were similar (if not the same) was very annoying. I had a hard time connecting with any of the characters due to the weaving in and out of other characters. I know that there was a family tree in the beginning, but I just got tired of flipping back to the point that I just did not care.To the average reader, without a discussion group or a literary expert, many of the \"hidden gems\" will be missed if there are any.

This is the only single word that I can use to describe this book.Although definatley unique it the composition style, the book is dark and depressing.

But I don't want rambling and confusing. I don't want to be spoon fed, but it would be nice if there were an identifiable path for the book.

It's the same boring stuff over and over again. The characters' names are all so similar it's impossible to keep track of who's who, but who cares, because the author doesn't give you reason to care about any of them anyway! It's business as usual for a long time with regards to realism, then out of nowhere.. a flying carpet.

The fantasy appears to be thrown in just for the sake of making incidences wild and imaginary and do not seem to be relative to the story or themes.

Heck, one Aureliano had 17 sons who were ALL named Aureliano. so, often times the reader cannot tell who Marquez is referencing without looking at the family tree graphic in the front of the book.Maybe I am not a deep thinker, but I found this book to be ponderous.

It's boring and annoying. The author randomly throws supernatural phenomena into the story at random points and doesn't have enough originality or creativity to explain it or make it interesting; he just moves on. No, sorry, I won't explain why this person is psychic. Oops, this person just snapped. Sorry. Hey, whaddya know! It's raining flowers.

It seemed stilted, contrived, lacking in fluidity, and devoid of any real color; an amateurish effort at best.Perhaps this reads better in its native tongue, but the translation I read was atrocious.

I have also read some of the reviews on this page and must conclude that either readers have terribly boring lives, that this kind of literature can be so compelling with the surreal and completely over exaggerated descriptive material.

This book came very highly recommended, but I've just been waiting and waiting to enjoy it. I think I've gone far enough and I can return it to the library.

I started reading this book at the suggestion of some colleagues, and a woman in my book club. I know it is considered a \"modern classic\", won the Nobel Prize, etc. - but I couldn't even pretend to like this book. To the author's credit, his imagery and descriptions are beautiful. I admired the magical world that was evoked by the style of storytelling. But the plot was next to nonexistent, and after about 100 pages, I really felt like I was on a road to nowhere. The story went off on tangent after tangent with no real, identifiable purpose. Reading this book gave me the feeling of being locked in a room with a very creative, yet nonsensical crazy person that won't shut up. After a while, it gets old.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: I can see its appeal to some, but I didn't like it....: I picked up this book to read it because several of my friends were reading in from the Oprah book club. It is a complex novel with many characters and a very mystical feel to it. The writing has a stream-of-consciousness style to it which makes you feel like you are listening to someone tell you a story with lots of side remarks. My issue with this novel was not the mystical feel or the writing style, though they do take some getting used to. My problem was that the whole thing just seemed to be about war and sex, and although both things have their place in life and literature, they weren't things that I wanted to read an enormous novel about. Also, this book is really quite tragic and I just prefer to read things with a more positive spin. I can see how this novel would appeal to some people because it is so complex and meaty....there is a lot to the stories in this book! It just wasn't for me.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.80)\n","\n","Review: Entertaining in short doses, funny in observation of people, hard work: I enjoyed it mostly although it was hard going. I'm not sure what it was about except I think it was partly about how we can live very close to other people and still not understand each other at all. This was a group of people leading lives of solitude although they were supposed to be family and community. I grew to like the weirdness like the ghosts, and the bizarre happenings. I think the author was writing as if what goes on in your own head was actually real. The cover said it was enthralling - I did not think so. It also said it was supernatural, magical which it was.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Brilliant: I took this book up twice before I could go through with it. First time I got confused by the character names. Second time I couldn't really understand the plot at all, because it was so strange and fantastical and dropped it 100 pp in. The third time I could not put it down. I think you need to have a strange sort of patience and level of acceptance for things that can't be easily categorized or named. Strange things happen in this town and to this family. Yet, in all the strangeness you can see real history, sad as it is.This book is one of very few that changed my life, my view of people, families, life. I think you need to be ready for this book in some way or another and be accepting. I saw a few people complaining that the book is immoral because it depicts incest. How can a book be immoral? Incest may be immoral but it happens in life and the book doesn't promote it in any way.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.98)\n","\n","Review: ******It Has It All********: Thank you Oprah for selecting this book. I absolutely loved it!I owned this novel for a few years before I actually sat down and read it. I often read the first page and felt it was dull - I was wrong. Solitude has become one of the best novels I've ever read. Garcia-Marquez not only includes vivid descriptions but also incorporates everything a novel should have from sibling rivalry, to war, loneliness, magic, humor, drama, incest, sex etc. Solitude is often mysterious and delves into all of our dark thoughts, while also showing our desires. I often found myself frustrated with the decisions the characters made yet understood why they made them.I cannot say enough about this wonderful novel, except I just regret waiting so long to enjoy it.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Rewarding.: This book is written with a meticulos particularity that is hard to grasp. Following the bloodline requires a geneology chart that was provided in the front cover of my copy.Gabriel Garcia Marquez captivated me with his realistic characters and the mystical events that shaped this area. Noticing a parrallel between the expansion of human beings from the beginning of civilization and the progress of the town of Macondo is essential to understanding the book's promise.The book is difficult and causes many people to put it down. However, after reading this book I placed it on the top of my bookshelf and admired its brillance. It is rewarding.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A Beautiful Translation: This book was beautifully translated, there was nothing that was lost. Every generation blends together so well that it's amazing. I know others find it boring at times, but I found that there isn't a moment of boredom while reading it. I loved this book. It was so very well-written, and the characters truly shine and come alive. I think everyone should read this classic!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Amazing!: This is absolutely the most wonderful book I've ever read. I read more than one book every week, so what can I say!! A must read, which you will not want to put down. There's so much to this than just the story.. Beautifully written and wonderously haphazard presentation!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: The purest novel describing the human condition.: This is not a happy book as many other readers have said in their reviews. It is a novel of depression and introspection showing both the saddest and brighest sides of solitude. But the characters' solitude is not like me locking myself up in my room to read this book. It is deeper, describing something existential, a way of life that is disciplined in the joyous festivities and in the deep mourning. My lasting impression of this book is not that of beauty or wonder, but shock in the speaker's accurate description of the human condition.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: 100 years of solitude: Garcia Marquez is the best writer in Latin America. He show to the hole world our pains, our fantasies and our feelings and nobody can make the same like him.

It took me six weeks to get halfway through it because it is so incredibly boring that I have a hard time motivating myself to pick it back up after putting it down.The characters range from unengaging to infuriating, their multitude and the fact that most of them have very similar names is confusing (especially since the story jumps back and forth in time), and their actions are often revolting (what a bunch of spineless, brainless women, and let's not even think about the macho men!).I find the book thoroughly unentertaining and pointless. What is the author trying to say? Is there a message somewhere? What kind of story is this supposed to be? Since it contains surreal things like flying carpets and quasi-immortal people, I'm guessing it's some sort of fairytale. If it is, all I can say is that the Brothers Grimm wrote better fairytales than this guy!\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: This books should be banned for 100 years in SOLITARY: This book won the NOBEL Prize?

Characters with the same name throughout the book. Non-linear time, too, it's very hard to follow. How could this \"book\" change your life? I have come to fear love, it's like your emotions are being dragged through the mud and everything you hold dear and ethical are just pushed away like its nothing. It was about incest, personally, maybe something was lost in the translation. It was so depressing and disturbing. I could not sleep without lights on after I finished reading it. I would never suggest this book to anybody who has a weak constitution or is easily emotionally disturbed. NOT good reading for a highschool student.

If I didn't have to endure chapter after chapter of people sleeping with each other who shouldn't be, incest, rape, pillaging, death, destruction, more incest, then maybe this book would have been as great as everyone makes it out to be. I understand the last chapter was supposed to explain everything in the book and it does to a point but it doesn't excuse the fact that this is NOT the next best thing to GENESIS! We reviewed this book in our book club and out of 20 women, only 2 liked the book. I think this book is way over popularized due to Oprah giving it a thumbs up in her book club. Maybe it reads better in Spanish..maybe more than one chapter in the book was mistranslated (yes, there are 2 chapters that are mistranslated). I'm not sure. ... Disappointing and a waste of money.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Book: This book is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the book. I could not understand this book at all.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.97)\n","\n","Review: Too melodramatic: This novel is written in very interesting and compelling prose, but its characters are hardly worth the effort. The charaters are obsessive bores that can only be compared to day time soap opera characters. After reading through half of this novel, I was so numb from the constant tragedy and melodrama, that I simply did not care what happened to the characters anymore. To make matters worse, the plot is extremely complicated and very difficult to follow, with new characters added every chapter.The most amazing thing about this book is its popularity and that it helped its author win the nobel prize.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Disappointing read: I was expecting a consistent story or at least an engaging narrative that takes fantastical twists. Instead, so many characters are introduced (many have the same name) making it very difficult to care about any of them. Also, the struggles between the rebels and whoever it is they are fighting (and why, come to think of it) are vague and uninteresting. I can't imagine what about this book is so transfixing to so many people. Count me out, I guess.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Don't waste your time if you don't absolutely have to.: I read this for a college course. If this is the best the world had to offer at the time (Pulitzer Prize winner), then I fear for this nation. It was confusing at the beginning (conflicting ideas presented - it speaks as if it were the beginning of the world, but the characters find ancient items). And the story line is jumbled.Personally, I found no enjoyment in the reading of it. The symbolizism that we were supposed to find was buried so deeply that I had to research it on the internet. I finally found a few things written on the symbolism, had to re-read most of the book to find it, and consummed quite a bit of headache medicine to get through it.It was far too long for what it had to say...which wasn't much. Never have I burned a book in my life. I took special joy in planning an overnight camping trip for the sole purpose of watching it burn.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Well-written but very graphic: 100 years of solitude is an extremely well-written novel. The town of Macondo is personified through the Buendia family. It was the Buendias who founded the town and their lineage that is followed in the story. The town (like the Buendia family) is a desolate and solitary place that rapidly matures until it is destroyed. From the founding of the town, to the installment of the banana company, to the town's destruction, Macondo is destined to remain in solitude. Like the Buendias, the town never really reaches its full potential. Although the novel is extremely graphic and somewhat depressing at parts, from a literary point of view, 100 years of solitude is a fantastic novel.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Fine, if you're that way inclined: Pretty easy to read, but a load of tosh, drivel,whatever you call it.

Read Rabelais instead, at least you get a bit of a chuckle.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Drawn Out: 100 Years of Solitude is a dense, confusing novel that is seemingly endless. Most of the characters have the same name - either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano for the boys and Amaranta or Remedios for the girls. The chapters are long and have large amounts of action. Most of the chapters are very similar: incest occurs, a child is born, named Jose Arcadio, he studies Melquiades, fights with some people, has a mistress, several children, and then dies. I do not recommend this book for anyone that wants a quick/easy/interesting read. It is well written and conveys many themes and such, but is purely painful to read.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.96)\n","\n","Review: The Emperor's New Clothes: Is the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the raving reviews here.

I choose it for my book club and purchased an audio tape - I think I got it from amazon.com - that really helped me make sense of it. Everybody in my club hated it-several were forced to read it in college and didn't want to read it again. I was captivated by the magical realism and the idea of the perpetual cycle of life. I'm surprised Oprah selected it - it is really difficult. I also read Love in the Time of Cholera and thought it was much easier to read. Marquez is an author everyone who loves reading should attempt. If you can just stop insisting on instant gratification and keep on reading even it it doesn't make sense and even if you can't keep track of all the characters-just keep on reading and let the story get into your blood.

It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilections.And speaking of predilections, Marquez, along with some other of intellectualdom's best and brightest, recently decided to weigh in on the Klinton-Lewinsky scandal (New York Times, Sep 26, 1998).

Many things were even quite good (I was particularly pleased that they kept Alfredo's father's second aria, which is usually cut out!), but there were more that were simply unremarkable.If this was the only video of La Traviata available I would be well pleased with it. It is satisfactory and, on stage, it was probably excellent. The only thing about it that really bothered me was that Alfredo, his father, and Violetta all looked about the same age and that would not, I think, have been apparent from the audience.However, there are several versions that are considerably better. This version is well worth seeing if you are interested in multiple interpretations of this opera, but if you wish to see only one, let it be a different one. There are three that I think are equally good: the version with Placido Domingo and Theresa Stratas, the version with Anna Moffo (though it has no subtitles), and a fairly new version with Jose Cura.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A Dream Version of La Traviata: This the best La Traviata I've ever seen/heard on DVD. Gruberova sounds like a blend of the best of Sutherland and Caballe. She sings the most difficult coloratura as if it's childsplay. The timbre of her voice is gorgeous! This is vastly better than Zeffirelli's (sp?) latest version that features a listless Violetta and a cramped staging. My only critique is that Shicoff (Alfredo) looks rather goofy and unattractive. His voice if fine - just not the kind of man women dream about ...Gruberova makes Sills and Angela G. pale by comparison. Her gowns look like something Garbo would have worn. The sets and ambience (the world's most gorgeous opera house)add a special magic to this fantasy version of one of Verdi's masterpieces.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Disappointing: I bought this book as a naive, newly-diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic last December. My experience with it has been significantly negative. The basic dietary premise that a diabetic should consume 50-60 percent of their daily diet from carbohydrates, just doesn't pass a sanity test. The very idea that I'm supposed to control my blood glucose by eating mostly foods that seriously elevate blood glucose is not eating away diabetes; it is eating your way into higher blood glucose. I had to abandon this eating plan early on, and have found a better solution.Look carefully at the glowing reviews; many were written by other \"professionals.\"\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A book to live by: Kristine Napier is obviously an authority on diabetes as well as a nutritionist-- and we could probably cure a national epidemic (Type 2 diabetes) if we would all follow the advice in this book.

Lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, are necessary to prevent complications (heart disease, stroke, vascular disease, blindness) in those with Type 2 diabetes and prevent the disease from occurring in those at high risk. Medical advice regarding diet often leaves patients confused and therefore unable to follow their advice. Kristine Napier defines Type II diabetes and the steps needed to control this disease in a way that is easy to understand. She provides advice and examples to help the reader incorporate her guidelines into their everyday life. Her 28 day guide of menus will help those get started and as always, Kris's recipes are easy to follow and delicious.

The Myth! The Hair!: This disc captures the first 1950s recordings of wild blues harmonica man Kid Thomas. These Chicago recordings predate the timing of his most well-known song \"Rockin' This Joint Tonight\" (if you can call it that, because I acknowledge Thomas is pretty obscure to begin with), but are great nonetheless, due to Kid's intense approach to 1950s-era Chicago electric blues. The overall feel is rough and tumble, and if you have any appreciation for Chess Records, this probably takes it a step further, as far as rocking goes.Be forewarned though - There are different takes of the same song, and several false starts on others, but the disc was such a rush upon first listen for me because of Kid's approach to the blues that I immediately played it again - it's been a while since a blues cd has done that to me.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Planning for elder care from a family point of view: Nothing could be more overwhelming than making arrangements for your elderly parents in a time of crisis. Long-term Planning for Your Parents is a easy to read guide for families who are planning ahead or those who need to make informed decisions quickly about long term health care/living arrangements. What makes this booklet unique is its focus on the emotional issues that your family will be facing when trying to make end of life decisions for your parents. Long-term Caring for Your Parents includes information on talking about money, negotiating the health care and government bureacracy, and dealing with family dynamics. The booklet contains practical tips, resources for more information, and a place to write notes and do research.

I am often reminded of Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy series when I read a Discworld novel. Excellent prose, and the dry, witty, British humor you can't get enough of.Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel featuring the Night Watch (the first was Guards! Guards!)The Watch features the crew from the previous book (Vimes, Carrot, Colon and Nobby) and some new recruits. Someone is murdered in a most mysterious way, and it's up to the Watch to get to the bottom of it.What I love about Pratchett is he doesn't settle to just write a witty satire. It's actually a great mystery/fantasy story with great characters who have excellent believable relationships.Men at Arms even has some scenes that I found emotionally stirring. I loved Guards! Guards! but I personally enjoyed Men at Arms more.

Pratchett is trying to be Douglas Adams and fails at it miserably. This story in particular was trite, condisending, and supremly unfunny. His use of footnotes to make a joke that had no bearing upon the story was...lame, for lack of a better term.The jokes, reeked of \"ho ho ho see how clever I am!\" rather than actually being funny. The characters struck me as pale shadows of characters who only grow and change in set and sadly predictiable ways so that they can advance the plot and story rather than being changed by the plot and story.I can't even say the story was silly lame.

This is in essence the design of Geoffrey Chauncer's \"Canterbury Tales\", a collection of stories told by a group of travelers on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Of these stories the most noted are \"The Knight's Tale\", \"The Wife of Bath's Tale\", \"The Miller's Tale\", \"The Reeve's Tale\", and \"The Parson's Tale\". Chaucer, born in the early 1340s (the exact date is unknown), lived a most notable life and had a profound impact on English literature. Much of his works are influenced by love and his distain for the Church in the form of satirical humor. The latter due impart to the corruption within the clergy and the condition of the people from their suffering of drought, famine, and disease. Chaucer's work brought to light a new age of literature full of wit, comedy, and daily life.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: better than Decameron: To acknowledge the mastery of Chaucer you 've got to read \"Decameron\" by Boccaccio and \"The Consolation of Philosophy\" by Boethius.Read them and send me news on the online-review. .\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: storytelling and fun: A fantastic book with great stories of many a people.

A humorous tavern owner suggests a way to help pass the time, everyone tells a story, and the persone who tells the best story gets a free dinner. The stories range from serious tales about chivalry and love (knight) to the disgusting and perverse (summoner). Apparently Chaucer planned to have each member of the party tell two tales, but I suppose he didn't get around to finishing the collection. Also, I think 1 or 2 of the stories are not complete, but that's in every edition you can buy.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: bad version to read: The annotation style if this edition ruins it.

It would be alright if we could view it page by page (in it's original format), but without that option it's harder to understand.

Though I have read my Everyman's Library version so many times I can repeat many sections word for word, I also own Nevill Coghill's translation and it is delightful. It is one of the best translations of the book which I have read. I, of course, would suggest reading it in Middle English, but if you are frusturated or confused by the language then I would recommend this translation.

Chaucer was involved with every level of society during his time. This is shown with how the characters are so well-rounded. The short, but insightful description of the travelers is also helpful in picturing this group riding on thier way to the shrine of Becket. A great book everyone should read, but one of those you have to be in the mood for.

It is agreed that each traveler will tell four tales to help pass the time, and the host of the inn will reward the best storyteller with a free supper when they return. The Canterbury Tales is a sometimes bawdy, sometimes spiritual classic, skillfully translated into modern English and presented in an unabridged audiobook format. Read by Martin Jarvis and a full cast, The Canterbury Tales reveals the trials and travails of daily life in late fourteenth-century England through stories, conversations, jokes and arguments between travelers. Truly the most memorable way to experience this literary classic, The Canterbury Tales is especially recommended for public library collections. 17 CDs, 21 hours, tracks every 3 minutes for easy bookmarking.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Classic: In order to understand English litterature and the English language, many have read, or at least tried to read, Chaucers \"Canterbury Tales\". I too did begin (and sort of finished) the work in Middle English, which is not as hard as one might be lead to think, but is quite labourious and painstakingly slow at times. With this version, a great compromise has been found, translating it as true to the original as possible yet in modern English. I know that every time you make a rewrite or translation, things are lost, but sometimes it is necessary, or just quite convenient. This is one of those times.It is great fun reading the Canterbury Tales. The structure of the work makes it very accesible and easy to pick up after some time away. You could treat it as a whole entity or as a collection of short stories centered around a group of persons on a pilgrimage.

It contains not only basic phrases that one might need to know in order to conduct ones self in the main parts of Laos but also be able to learn some of the country's culture as well.

I tried the book with several english speaking lao persons and lao speaking native english speakers while travelling around the country and all had problems with the transliteration. Nothing is like you would naturally pronounce it. For example who would say Khoj if you see Khawy?Helpful is the lao bit so you can point, in the end its how I got around.

There were so many human flaws, which I love it so much. It wasn't one of those movies where one character was absolutely perfect while the other one was downright horrible, but the flaws were evenly placed like real humans. We all have flaws, only different. We're all different.Once again, I love the film, although I loved the book so much more. It was so much more touching than the film had been, although the movie was great! The letters in the book were a lot more touching in the movie, maybe because I can actually see the spelling mistakes Ugolin and Papet makes.

This poignant tale is set in Provence in southern France. The beautiful scenery is truly breathtaking. Heard throughout, the haunting score will stay in your mind for days after viewing the film.

The story has a sad ending, but thought provoking. The excitement, energy and the fierce determination of Jean de Florette is inspiring. This city dweller is so determined to succeed as a farmer that he will give up under no circumstance. Beware that the French spoken in this movie is not the Parisian French, the Provence accent makes it very hard to understand, in case you are a student of French.

Film grain is evident throughout and at times the highlight values of the picture seem overexposed.I give the movie 5 stars. I give the \"transfer\" 1 star.

Manon des Sources is far superior, but there aren't many films that hold a candle to Manon, foreign language or otherwise.I certainly agree that this has to be seen to appreciate Manon.

You may even see stories in your own life play out concurrently while you watch this story.The French certainly do know how to tell a story.

It is easy to see how Cameron was so moved by Pellegrino's morphings through time. A reading of this scientist's other books reveals that he seems to be unable to tell a tale in linear fashion. In both \"Unearthing Atlantis\" and \"Ghosts of the Titanic,\" he unfolds archaeological investigations by telling the whole history backwards!

Pellegrino obviously is trying for emotional meditative discourse, but failing that, ends up making up out of whole cloth entire conversations and scenarios. Titanic was *not* the first ship to use the SOS call. The inclusion of the Frank Towers myth is a dead giveaway that Pellegrino picks and chooses his myths, without bothering with such inanities as fact-checking.

Pellegrino draws from neither for his book, instead creating unfounded dialogues that, unfortunately, shed a bad light on some of the heros of that night. His extreme emotionalism - he takes it almost to the point of being farcical - distracts the reader from the events of both the 1912 sinking and the 1985 finding of the Titanic. This book had the potential to create a fascinating discourse between the two main events in the life of the liner, both academically and emotionally, but unfortunately it doesn't.

She writes elegantly and truthfully. The setting for Vein of Iron is an area of rural Virginia where I spent much of my childhood. I don't think it has changed much! In this novel, there are wonderful passages about the impact of Christian beliefs on the life of the people who settled in the region (which can surely be generalized to many rural settlements throughout the U.S.). Glasgow creates a fascinating character in Ada's father, who struggles with his spirituality. Ada is strong, faithful, optimistic- just as I imagined our female predecessors to be at that time. This is a character-driven, setting-driven novel, and I loved it. My daughter surprised me with it for mother's day. Thanks, daughter!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Pulitzer Prize Winner: Not really a review, but I collect Ellen Glasgow books. It should be noted in her bio here that she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1942 for In This Our Life. I don't see that book here on Amazon, but it should be since it was a Pulitzer Prize winner. I saw that some say her books are \"overwritten,\" but you must take them in the context of when they were written. She is a wonderful author and depicts life in the South and rural America extremely well. Her real gift is her insight into her characters and what makes all of us human.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: a pleasant reminder of the British Invasion: Listeners of this cd will be reminded that, in the era of just three guitars and a drummer, the British Invasion provided a pleasant change from American sounds in the early 1960s. The sound quality of this cd is remarkable. On \"Don't Throw Your Love Away\" you can actually hear someone in the studio rustling some papers at the very start of the song. The opening drum riff on \"Needles and Pins\" will stir the blood of any Mersey listener. This album is nothing but pop....but pure, straight and beautiful pop it is with jingle jangle guitars and high harmonies covering songs that strongly hint of a lost era of innocence. Either you love this stuff ...or you don't!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A selection---we need a complete set of all they did.: The Searchers are still touring and I saw them last year in Bay Shore, new York state. This album here is fine, BUT the group's work is much more worth getting INTO. We need the biggest most complete set possible. It is hard to get new listeners to hear some of their best songs: The World is Waiting for Tomorrow, Lovers Will, All a Dream, Till I Met You, and so many more. Buy this if it's the best in your price range and then join the groups on the web where you can expand your Searchers appreciation! And don't forget to read Frank Allen's memoir of the group's history.

He has already destroyed my soaker hose around the foundation of my house, most of my plants, my sprinklers, a lot of the siding on my house....and more (the swings never had a chance). I think this thing is great and looks like it will work well, but I will have to wait to hopefully get its full use. One of th great things about it is that it has the cedar in it to prevent bugs and stuff from getting on him. I just have to hope this destruction phase will end soon.

Coyote Ugly is just repeating this, with a particularly annoying character who suffers from one of the most demented looking cases of stage fright I've ever seen.Jerry Bruckheimer usually does good films, but this is a case in which I would love to ask him what he was thinking. The only attraction to this film is a bunch of girls dancing on top of the bar, and the singing of LeAnn Rimes. He could easily have just made a few music videos and dispensed with the vehicle for presenting them. It would have done us all a favour.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: a teenagers opion: Ok I really like this movie I mean the story line was awesome.

We get a nice introduction to Piper Perabu, who may well be the next Alicia Silverstone or Cameron Diaz. It is basically a story of a naive girl from New Jersey who comes to New York to persue her dream as a singer/songwriter.When she realizes that she isn't going to be an instant success, she takes a job in club with the title name. Her dancing skills improve and her fear of perfoming in front of crowds starts to diminish. She incidentally meets a nice young man whom she starts seeing, and though there are troubles, her move to the top is going strong by the end of the movie.The plot is very predictable, but the acting is well above average. It was nice to see of movie of this genre with relatively little foul language. I don't believe the \"F\" word was used at all. All in all, a nice and enjoyable movie that is suitable for most members of the family. I recommend it.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: This movie was trite.: The storyline was cliched and the one-liners weren't even funny. The Australian accent from the cute boyfriend was annoying. Piper Perabo can NOT act (even though she's hella cute) and all the coyotes were too pretty. It was distracting. Don't waste your time.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Can&#65533;t fight the moonlight&#65533;: Okay, I'm a sucker for John Goodman, and he's by far the sexiest in the cast. I'll admit that I enjoyed the movie mainly because (a) I did not actually pay for the rental, and (b) I was consuming large amounts of alcohol at the time. To the film's credit, even in my drunken stupor I could tell that the scenes in which Piper pretends to sing were incredibly corny. I think I remember falling off the sofa and landing on my head from the extreme cheese-ness. You know? The kind that makes your skin crawl?In true Bruckheimer form, Leanne Rimes organizes a high-speed train robbery which results in a spectacular car wreck involving two commercial airliners and the Seattle Space Needle... but I don't want to spoil it for anybody. See it for yourself (read: do not see this for yourself). Two stars.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.73)\n","\n","Review: pure formula junk: This is the kind of film I get stuck watching on long plane rides and would NEVER seek myself. It is such silly schlock that I marvel at how the Hollywood mill can churn these things out and make money - it's really an industrial production process, geared to superficial viewers.This is one of the basic plots. THe others include crippled boy, whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk, love, or talk. Why do we keep watching this junk? A video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome.OK, here goes: beautiful girl with a dream, seeking big break, gets gig in a bar, handles it, meets boy who doesn't fit into plans, shakes it, shakes it more, shakes it a lot more, flirts with corruption, stays course, makes real friends, gets to know real self, grows. Oh, and then succeeds on her own terms.Not recommended. Admittedly, the acting in not abysmal, but what a waste of time about lives that could never exist.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: EXTRA SHARP CHEESE!: I'm all for a light entertaining movie but this thing was painful to watch. Mix Piper Perabo as the lead role, a bubble headed blond who couldn't act to save her life, add an old hashed to death storyline embedded with every cliche in the book and you have Coyote Ugly. This thing was horrible, just horrible. After the first five minutes I got sick of watching Perabo's only acting skill making those sad puppy dog faces. But guess what it goes on the rest of the movie, must be a record for that annoying facial expression. It's a good thing this is a rental so I can send it back tomorrow, if I was suckered into buying this disc I would have to drench it with gasoline and set it on fire.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Coyote Ugly Is da bomb!: Coyote Ugly is the best film i have ever seen.

A good story: This film deals with two different plots: An aspiring singer and a bar named Coyote Ugly. The story is a very good one about a young and inexperienced women (Violet) trying to make it as a singer in the Big Apple, but the problem is she has Stage Fright- that's where the bar comes in and the movie really takes off.Violet ends up getting a job in the bar as one of the women who serve drinks while dancing on the bar. The scenes in the bar coupled with the great music really gives the film energy and keeps the pace from getting too slow. They do not take away from the story, but hold it together. Working here helps Violet acquire the confidence she needs to make. There is also a love story between Violet and a guy she meets which completes the whole movie and makes it well worth watching.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Loved it: Don't know why but can't stop watching this movie.

However, if you want plotless mush and adore watching the heaving, bouncing chests of model-esque women, then you will probably love this movie.

What little plot it has is overdone and you can predict what each move will be.Nothing but fluff.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Greg's Review: I bought this to replace my DVD copy that was stolen. I liked that fact that it was on Blu-Ray so I could play it on my PS3 and get the most out of the movie. Overall there were not a lot of additional scenes to the Blu-Ray than the DVD editon. Some scenes are longer on this edition than on the DVD. There is a nude scene which has to be a body-double of Piper.

By the third screening, I wanted the plane to crash.Without a shred of revealed flesh, the film teases, tantalizes, and seduces without ever gratifying. There is nary a thong in this picture!This is eroticism without the eroticism.It's a bit like a soft-core film made for Nickelodeon.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: If only I could convince my wife: I was forced to watch this movie with my wife, who insisted we rent it. Normally, we agree on the movies we watch and the ones she forces down my throat are never as bad as I thought they were going to be. This movie changed all of these notions.It starts off like another \"Flashdance,\" which was a decent movie. But then it becomes a long music video, with dialogue thrown in to keep you from falling asleep.Well, it didn't work for me. Even the brilliant John Goodman could not save this movie. Nothing but T & A for the teeny bopper crowd.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Unnecessary...: Hoping this \"unrated\" version will show something the original version didn't?Don't get your hopes up.As with a host of other recent \"unrated\" editions of theatrical turkeys (The Girl Next Door, Club Dredd, Eurotrip, The Chronicles of Riddick, etc.), there's nothing in this version to give it a \"harder\" rating -- it's unrated simply because the studio didn't submit THIS cut to the MPAA.Unless you really, REALLY want to see all the deleted scenes from your old DVD copy of \"Coyote Ugly\" re-cut back into the film, don't waste your time or money on this trick.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: These chicks think they're so cool and tough: Yeah, let one of 'em spend a day with Ted Bundy... let's see how damn tough they act after such an experience.

I found myself looking for women in the bar. NONE. this is just Pig S#*T. You are a jerk if you think this is cool.

Screw college, screw learning there is more to you then your looks... looks don't fade, they last forever! (right) My boyfriend doesn't understand why I don't want to watch this movie every time it comes on tv. Because it perpetuates a thing women have been trying to get away from for thousands of years; being judged as people who will use their looks instead of their brains to get what they want, being judged as nothing but a body and no more. Any THINKING woman will not like this film and will not want any young girls she knows to watch it, either. It is not a good example for the young women of today.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Not worth buying...a renter at best: A plot and story that has been done before, better.

All the little things she did to help out the bar in an attempt to get back to work with Cyote Ugly made me want to upchuck all over the television.

Also with this tale is lots of fun and enjoyment. At the end, you can't forget when LeAnn Rimes comes in as a country music sensation (herself) and performs Violet's song she recorded.

The soundtrack for the movie is also of high quality and most of it is integrated into the movie at the right time. A few people have been giving negative reviews on here about this film, and I can just say that I don't agree. On the contrary, what more could you want from a film that doesnt try to be too much, and is mainly just a down to earth story about a small-town girl trying to make something of her life in a big city.

Unlike Violet, I don't have stage fright, as a matter of fact, I love being on stage. However, taking 'odd' jobs is something that I'm very relatible to. Even tho I've never taken a job at a bar quite like Coyote Ugly, it shows that when you are trying to achieve a dream, you do whatever possible. So far when it comes to dancing on a bar, I've only ever done it for fun, but it just goes to prove that we don't have an easy time of it trying to make it in the music business, and this type of scenerio is incredibly possible because when you're desperate, you do whatever it takes, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of dignity...even tho you can still have a hell of a lot of fun doing it.

This is Tyra Bank's first big movie breakout and see does it nice.

This film explains the reason why I have nightmares from taking, eventually dropped out of, Women's Studies in college. I don't need to be manhandled like that by a film like Coyote Ugly, telling me that women like those depicted in the film are the bomb and everything. I rather watch true films, touching realistic issues that surround females such as Hoop Dreams, My Left Foot, and The Miracle Worker, not crappy movies like Coyote Ugly. What's up with the title? Really, what's up with the concept? No, really...what's up with the actual realization of this movie being made?

Also, I don't understand why the movie switched between color and black-and-white -- I'm guessing the decision was made in a very late editing session because it didn't seem to have any context.

Again, if I were a 14 year old girl, I would probably like this movie because it was geared towards 12-17 year old girls. To give the movie some credit, it was kind of a \"cute\" story, but thats about it. (Also, no bar like that is going to have only 1 bouncer, gimme a break!)\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Coyote Ugly: I usually dont give reviews of movies becuase everyone else does and it sums up what I have to say but I read the reviews for this movie and was very dissapointed. I went three times to see this moive. It was exectly every time I saw it. I even bought the soundtrack which was wonderful. The movie was Awsome. It shows how you should never give up on anything that you really want -boy or girl- becuase it can be acheived. I belive that everyone should see this movie!!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.96)\n","\n","Review: excruciating...: I had to add my two cents because reading the good reviews about this movie blew my mind. They had to have all been written by 13 year old teeny boppers. I only sat through this movie because the people I went to the theater with needed a ride home. I was really looking forward to this movie too. The commercials made it look like it was going to be hot chicks doing wild and crazy stuff at the bar through the whole thing but I'd have to say that only about 15 minutes of this movie took place at the bar. Piper Perabo annoyed the crap out of me. She was always making these puppy dog faces like she is saying, \"Look how cute and adorable I am.\" The story was trite and cliche'... I actually felt insulted that the director thought I might be stupid enough to buy into this ridiculous crap. If you aren't a 13 year old girl don't go see this.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Coyote Alert!: I thought this film was great, especially as there is a real bar in NY like the one in the film. Coyote Ugly is an excellent film for pretty much everyone to see, and the CD is also good. If you dislike this film, then why are you looking at buying it anyway???\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Good intentions... Horrible execution.: Piper Perabo is a great new face in Hollywood and I look forward to seeing what she does next. That said, I believe the director and editor (more on that later) should be taken to a public place and caned with a bamboo pole.What starts as a cute girl-coming-of-age-in-the-big-city movie begins to fall apart the moment the girl who's too shy to sing in front of anyone starts working in a bar that requires her to dance on the bar while getting buckets of water dumped on her. \"Oh I'm too shy to sing one of my songs in front of my new date, but I'll strip for him!\" What???There is a spasmatic sequence with a phone call, a trip to a club, a family reunion and a performance that had to have been spliced together by an MTV editor that drank way too much Mountain Dew while eating pixie sticks. One character even repays a debt that was cut out so she couldn't have even known that she owed it!Hopefully Piper will have better luck with \"Slap Her, She's French\" this year.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Pretty Girls with a thin plot: The movie stars Piper Perabo who is a very likeable actress. The only problem is that she is stuck with boring dialog and a weak plot. If you are going to make a movie about a crazy bar and the lifestyle of a young bartender in New York City why would you make it PG-13. How wild and crazy can you get. Its kind of ironic that the cover of this movie reminds me of a Spice Girls poster. Stay away from this one if you have any interest in a plot and charachters.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A waste of plastic and metal....: This is without a doubt the most brainless movie ever made. Created for the \"Frat Boy\" demographic, Coyote Ugly is packed with scantilly clad hoochies dancing around on bar tops and acting very badly. The hoochies are impressive but that is the only halfway worthwhile aspect of this dreadful film. The plot is a stupid retread of the \"small town girl goes to the big city\" story ,the producers did'nt even try very hard to make a decent film around all the \"T\" & \"A\".Why would anyone want watch Coyote Ugly at a theatre or buy it on DVD when movies like this can be seen on late night cable seven days a week? At least the \"acting\" is better on those cable shows.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Don't go there: 'Coyote Ugly' often gets compared to 'Flashdance'and sort of falls in the same genre, but it lacks both the charme and the choreography that made 'Flashdance' a success. It is hard to blame the actors for the failure to maintain the audience's interest, they simply didn't have anything to work with. The plot is entirely predicable, and all the characters (how did they do that?) remain without any depth. As a result, the different plots running through this feature appear strangely unrelated, maybe because as a viewer one just doesn't get engaged. Easily one of the worst offerings in the last 12 months, maybe ever.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Coyote Ugly ROCKS!: Coyote Ugly is one of the best movies i've seen so far. When i walked out of the theatre after watching Coyote Ugly, i was like \"WOW! That was a really good movie\". The actors are fantastic, cinematography was good, on top of that, the SOUNDTRACK is really really cool. I immediately went to the stores to get the soundtrack to the movie. Some people think that this movies has a lot of \"sexual\" content, but i think it's nothing more than just a few pretty ladies in nice looking outfits having the time of their lives. This movies is a MUST-WATCH and certainly worth the money to get it. Trust me, it's really fantastic.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: i hated this movie: I had the misfortune of paying my hard earned allowance on this movie. It was so pitiful I had to walk out before the half way point. How did I know it was the half way point? Easy I was checking my watch every 2 minutes. The plot was so thin and cliched...Oooh I wonder if she is gonna make it as a star? .... It was horrible, it was a waste of money and resources, if you want to save the environment, make sure movies like these don't get made. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie, if you want a good romantic story this is not the place to find it. There are so many other good movies for you to watch. I don't have a personal thing about it, but it upset me so much I had to tell the world. Please, please, please don't watch this movie and if you know someone who liked this trash then slap them upside their head, they deserve it and perhaps need some kind of shock therapy as well.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Good Picture-Great Audio: I was not so impressed with the video quality. It was a bit grainly, but better than the DVD copy. Blu-ray gives you the newer lossless sound that will rock your world. You will feel like you are in the bar.I recommend this because of the sound quality and it is worth the upgrade if you like this movie.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Another tax-loss movie?: You know you're watching a bad movie when your partner leans over to you and, without ever having seen the movie before, outlines the plot in detail, including accurate descriptions of most of the scenes to follow minutes after the opening credits have run.What on earth was Bruckheimer thinkning when he made this? I can only assume he had a contract with the studio to produce a certain number of movies and this was one of his 'fillers'.An unlikely plot to say the least, the acting was substandard and John Goodman, usually a decent actor, looked embarassed to be associated with this, seemingly hanging about in scenes waiting for his check to clear before he could leave.I've no doubt this movie earns at least 4 stars from many people who use this site; the teenage girl and mid 20's male I'm sure think this is an 'awesome' movie. Utter dross; Hollywood really needs a fresh injection of writing talent.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.96)\n","\n","Review: Dont make me laugh, no really dont bother.: I was forced to watch this film with my girlfirend. I admit to being a film snob, and ask alot of the film i watch. But when it comes to mindless Buckhiemer stuff i really dont mind them. Then i saw this. Badly acted, scripted and directed. This film represents the kind of mindless stagnation that hollywood seems intent on sticking with.

Please for your own sanity dont bother.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A Great Sexy Movie!: All the reviews said bad acting but beautiful women. I think both were great. This movie is based on a girl that wants to be a singer but has terrible stage fright. She goes to work in a bar, \"Coyote Ugly\" and this is where the beautiful women come in. They get their money by dancing on the bar. She makes the cut, but then has to make up $300 to stay. She does it and also makes her first singing appearance here. There is also the love story that is tangled in. She gets caught up with a guy that says he's a producer, but he isn't. But they make up and end up together. Despite her fathers disagreements, she continues to stive for her goal to be a singer. She ends up with the guy and the ability to sing on stage in a happy ending. Overall, this is a very sexy movie with an interesting plot, including Leanne Rimes giving a private concert at the bar. The dancing and singing is great and I recommend this as a good date movie.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: It's Entertainment, Folks: I am so tired of reading reviews from people who think every movie should be an artistic masterpiece, or at the very least, should have a poignant message. This is one of the most entertaining films my wife and I have seen in a long time, and none of the people involved with its production have anything to apologize for. It unquestionably delivers exactly what Bruckheimer, et al intended, and it does not pretend to be anything else. If I wanted something artistic or meaningful, I would have looked for word \"Miramax\" on the outside of the box - a studio that has made many wonderful movies, but not the type of high impact, SIMPLE fun Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have delivered so well. Sometimes, it's just what the doctor ordered.Turn out the lights, turn up the volume, break out the popcorn, have a few drinks, and enjoy...\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Howlingly Horrible: This was one of the most embarassingly bad films I've seen in recent memory.I watched this because there is a 14 year old in the house who is understandably amused by girls in their early twenties dancing on top of a bar....and is willing to watch a non-plot for a half-hour between those scenes. Short of a pubescent male, I have to think that anyone who enjoyed this movie is either miguided (hopefully) or an idiot.If this is really what a person looks for in a film, let me recommend saving your money and watching nearly any television sit-com....they're just as bad and it won't cost you four bucks a pop. Take that extra four bucks and donate it to the library. That way, people who are dragging the human race intellectually down to such a depth can at least offset the damage they do by hopefully lifting someone else up.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Bruckheimer Should Stick With \"Guy\" Movies...: I'm usually not disappointed with a Bruckheimer film, so this was definately a first. The plot was cheesy and slow: All-American, apple-pie, girl next door goes to \"The Big City\" to make it big in the music business...Meets good-looking orphan who helps her overcome stage fright in the most romantic of ways. The movie would have been better if it was, indeed, about the women of Coyote Ugly. The bar owner's story would have resulted in a better movie and a less misleading title. This movie will most likely be a hit with teeny bopper Backstreet Boys fans and junior high school age boys.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Coyote Aint So Ugly: Thsi movie delivers with a little of everything, action, romance, and a little something extra for the guys. Violet, a little town girl, has roamed into the big city in search of her dream. To be a professional songwriter. The only way to make the money she needs to support herself she has to get from dancing on a bear at a local pub, or so it seems.

She stops working at the first bar because she's financially secure.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.64)\n","\n","Review: Like the first, but withoutt he dark edge.: This album still has the great vocals, and the rock and techno combination. So whats the big difference between this and their self- titled album? The songs on this one don't have the same dark edge and I don't think that Shirley's vocals work as well. That being said its still a good album and worth a buy (after you've purchased their first). Best songs:Temptation Waits- Seductive.I think I'm Paranoid- Has a pretty dark vibe to it.When I grow up- Being a teenager I really relate to the lyrics.Medication- It does for this album what \"Queer\" did for their first.Special- Catchy.Push it- Interesting lyrics.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Garbage Sharpen Their Sound With Version 2.0: Garbage continues in the tradition of their debut on Version 2.0. They never really break new ground, but at the same time, really don't need to. Their brilliant formula of avant-pop rock with dancefloor beats works all the way without sounding recycled or stale. Shirley's voice polishes the assault of instantaneously addictive riffs, both even sharper than they were on their self-titled debut. After bingeing in the dark, Garbage contrasts with flickers of light on Version 2.0, without losing their intensity or our attention. A fantastic follow-up to a wonderful debut.

Sometimes they sound like a new-wave band, sometimes sing the beautiful ballads (\"The Trick Is To Keep Breathing\" or \"You Look So Fine\"), sometimes they sound angry (\"I think I'm Paranoid\"), but all the songs that are here get along really well.

Shirley Manson's voice was so great although a sad one...and a little bit creepy. The lyrics are quite creepy too. Much better than the debut was.Stars: I Think I'm Paranoid, Push It, You Look So Fine\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: One of my all-time favorites: This CD was my introduction to Garbage, and it could be that bias but I think that Version 2.0 is much superior to the debut. The singles that attracted me were \"I Think I'm Paranoid\" and most of all the sparkling \"Special.\" This album has a mood-swinging way about it, while the first one was mostly consistant, so you're getting both energetic pop songs and brooding, more rock pieces. I remember that I got tired of songs like \"Hammering in My Head\" on the first listen, but now it's my favorite. The best thing about this album, though, is it's emotional impact-- it plays like a story, and it never fails to move me. The best example is You Look So Fine -- absolutely haunting. Of course it probably has a lot to do with the time of my life when I discovered this CD, but it's made an impact on me that will stay with me forever.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GARBAGE.: This CD is a wonderful outstanding effort. My only worry is that they put all their eggs in one basket....How can they do better than this one? Every song is a wonder of its own. My favorites \"Special\", and \"Temptation Waits\". In my opinion this should of won as best CD of the year at the grammies over Lauryn Hill handsdown. Don't miss this one.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Great followup, but I like the debut better: This is now doubt 1 of the best albums of 1998. It is very reminiscent of the debut, but the more I listened to it, the more it was a little too much on the techno side. Shirley's voice saves that, though. The 1st track \"Temptation waits\" reminded me a lot of the power that \"Supervixon\" had, & \"Special\" was better before radio started killing it. And just like the 2 slow songs in the debut, the slow tracks 8 & 12 have the same hypnotic effect. I overplayed this ALMOST as much as the debut, & even though I like the debut a little more because of the slightly darker tone, I wasn't disappointed with this cd. Garbage just plain rocks.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.92)\n","\n","Review: OH MY GOD GET THIS ALUBUM>>>ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE 1ST!!: It's hard to top the first album that I got when I was 9 but this one almost does it.

This album really cemented that fact! Both Garbage albums are 4 stars and I recommend owning both! Verson 2.0 has a great guitar sound! And with songs Like \"Special\" and \"Push It\" Shirley Manson embodies the meaning of the phrase \"hell hath no fury like a woman scorned!\" Buy this cd! I won't steer you wrong!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: More mature look at Garbage: Seven words: \"I want Shirley Manson to adopt me.\"Why? Because she exudes the powerful, seductive, and charismatic character that makes Garbage a force to be reckoned with. In addition to the radio-friendly \"Push It\" and \"Special\", Garbage shows a similar but more mature scope of musical stylings in this, their sophomore effort following their self-titled debut. My personal favorites: \"Temptation Waits\", \"When I Grow Up\", \"Medication\", and \"You Look So Fine.\"Seeing them live made me just love them more, and I think first-time listeners will immediately appreciate the mystical powers of this electrically-infused band by just listening to this album. If everyone listened to it and heard Shirley speak to them the way she speaks to so many through music, I think everyone would want Shirley to adopt them.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Great CD!: I loved the first CD, but was doubtful about the 2cnd, since I'm used to the first CD being the better one.

Though \"The Trick...\" was the only good song with their new sound, \"Hammering...\" and \"Sleep Together\" seem to be overusing the guitar sound, ruining two of the twelve songs.If Garbage wants to adjust their sound a little bit, they should stick to the elements of \"Special\" and \"The Trick...\" and go from there.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Paranoiac...: This record gives one a nightmare.

Like a lot of really good groups, there are a large number of truly great songs on this CD that you won't hear anywhere unless you buy the CD.

I know, I was a stupid boy. \"Version 2.0\" is when I realized this is an amazing band. I'd be shocked if any fan of techno, pop, alternative, or girl-fronted-rock-bands didn't love this disc. In itself it's almost the best of Garbage. They all sound like singles. Other than the obvious 3-4 hits, I was most impressed by \"Temptation Waits\", \"Medication\", \"The Trick Is To Keep Breathing\", and \"You Look So Fine\". If you've ever thought about getting some Garbage, especially this album, do it. Don't be a stupid boy/girl.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Garbage is great!: Garbage's first album was a without-a-doubt 5 star, probably my favorite album ever. Version 2.0 is really good, but just a notch under the first. Still it is pretty darn good! The album doesn't have super hits like \"Stupid Girl\" \"Queer\" or \"Only Happy When It Rains,\" but it does have good songs. My favorite, which sounds like the Garbage most people know, is \"Temptation Waits.\" \"Hammering in my Head\" is great, too. The most popular ones, \"Push It\" and \"I Think I'm Paranoid,\" are popular for a reason, too. Overall, it is a great album.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Just when you think it couldn't get any better.: I waited and waited for v2.0, it's the first product in sometime that hasn't shipped with bugs.

I own many CDs and there's new stuff I like out there but Garbage and their album Version 2.0 are too awesome. Butch Vig, Duke Erikson, Steve Marker, and of course, a role model I really admire, Shirley Manson-- really kick serious a$s! I also recommend the acclaimed GARBAGE debut and obviously, a trip to the official website. Needless to say, VERSION 2.0 blows me away. Seductive, sexy, music, man.

The haunting melodies, hooks, riffs, and tempest refrains are incredible. It follows the same formula as the 1995 debut but polishes it, and makes it much catchier. The standout songs are (practically all on the CD): Temptation Waits, I Think I'm Paranoid, When I Grow Up, Special, Push It, The Trick Is to Keep Breathing, Dumb, Sleep Together, Wicked Ways, and You Look So Fine . . . and all the other songs are nearly as great.

I have to say that I'm not as passionate about the show as I used to be; the characters Lucas and Peyton left and I thought that would ruin the show. However, that just lead to the show growing and getting to know smaller characters more. Season seven of One Tree Hill is amazing and the actors/actresses are great. It's a good show and the dvd allows for episodes to be watched without commercials. It's also the smallest and most compact dvd case out of all of the seasons (I have all 7). I would recommend this item.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Terrible season. Terrible stories.: First of all, Peyton was my favorite character. Second of all, Haley, Mouth and Millie are unlikable characters, in my opinions. Does anyone care about Skills and his girlfriend Lauren, or Mouth and his job? And YET again, Nathan and Haley's marriage is on shaky ground. Everything seems recycled. Fortunately, Clay is the beacon of the light. A likable guy who seemed unable to commit, he found his love in Quinn. Yet again Schwahn decides to kill someone off, this being Haley and Quinn's mother. Yet again, Schwahn uses the plot line of a crazy stalker. Unfortunately, the character of Dan is not in much of the season. Attempts to be funny were made, such as the girls getting high of pot brownies. Attempts failed. Terrible season. The only reason I will watch season 8 is because of Clay, and because I've been watching since the beginning.

This season was pitiful There were points that you laugh out loud from it being so stupid and corny. Nobody acts like they do and Jamie's character which was good in the 5th and 6th seasons has become stupid. The show isn't the same without Lucas and Peyton, it's just dumb. The writing is just terrible, worst show of the year. I've never seen anything so corny. The new characters are ok, but this show shouldn't be surviving without Lucas and Peyton because it is so pointless and stupid without them. Even without them, it's too bad the writers and producers couldn't make it interesting and dramatic. Instead it's full of games, messes, snowball fights, and stupidity.

I found it disjointed. There seemed to be a lot of time spent shouting down the telephone and smoking cigaretes which would be fine if the conclusion satisfied me, it didn't.The main Character, played by Jane Fonda, seemed naive and hopeless, the title character, played by Vanessa Redgrave was such an enigma that she was unbelievable in substance and played far to minor a role in the film. The only reason that I would like to know what happened next is simply to find out if any strength of resolve would be found!

The most compelling part in this movie is where Lillian and Julia meet in the cafe. Julia tells Lillian that she has named her daughter for her. Julia finally reaches over and puts her hand on Lillian's and says \"My beloved friend. Go!\" Yet another potent reminder of the courage of the Resistance fighters in the face of Nazi terror.

It's hard to follow the poses when you can't see the instructors feet b/c they're buried in the sand and unless you have a decent knowledge of yoga there are a lot of important details about many of the poses that are left out.

Peggy seems like a regular soccer mom who decided that she could make a yoga video. Her instructions arent good and her form is not good enough to be teaching others. The editing is pretty bad.

I tried pretty much everything -- physical therapy, tons of stretching, chiropractic care -- and nothing really provided nay lasting results.A friend of mine recommended trying yoga as a remedy, but I never took it seriously until I saw the Yoga for Surfers video. I figured I'd buy the tape and give it a try (heck, I tried everything else!). And after two months, I was virtually pain free! I've been doing it for 6 months now and it has been an amazing turnaround. I also picked up Yoga for Surfers II and I'm working my way into that routine.When my dad told me he had back pain, I also got him this dvd, and I know he'll love it.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Don't buy the dvd, and don't buy into the fabricated 5 star reviews: I purchased this as a video, and was not that impressed.

Skip this DVD, take a lesson at your local yoga place.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Great DVD: This is a great DVD, especially for someone who never did yoga before.Works great before my surf sessions.

Particularly if you are not familar with yoga already. The poses are not explained as well as in most not-for-surfers DVDs. Often times, you can not see the feet of the instructor, so you do not know how to place your feet unless you already know the pose. I think Peggy is probably a good instuctor, but this DVD isn't a good example. The best part of this DVD is the advert for Rochelle's surf camp, which includes a cameo appearance of Minnie Driver. I found this portion of the DVD to be inspiring. If you are looking for some instruction on yoga poses, this is not a good choice.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.86)\n","\n","Review: Nothing especially helpful for surfing: This is a generic, cheesy yoga video with plenty of 'namaste' B.S. to go around. The poses are fine and good, but the video doesn't really offer up any yoga that is different and specific to surfing.

Even though I've practiced yoga for some time, I learned a lot from this program, especially from the post-surf session which has unique and effective rejuvenating poses. The music is enchanting and adds to the uplifting nature of the program. And the quality of this video is the best I have ever seen - gorgeous surf and beach scenes and top-notch editing between the poses. I recommend this video to everyone!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Terrible textbook: This is the course book assigned by my college professor. I found the book to be disorganized, confusing and incomplete. Vocabulary words are often spread out throughout the chapter in odd places.

Often times they will provide you with a vocab word, but no translation beside it.

The author also claims that many of the bombers landed with little or no damage, insinuating that they were intentionally getting out of the war. This is also false- the AAF conducted an extensive investigation during the war, and found that almost every bomber that landed in Switzerland had extensive damage.

Buy this great collection of songs and give your heart a treat! After all to quote a Jennifer Warnes song \"all we have is here and now\".

That isn't Jennifer singing on track 18!: The duet with Steve Gillette ( track 18) is actually a recording of another friend of Steve Gillette's, not Jennifer Warnes . How tacky! How could RAVEN have missed that? I had to adjust the volume knob about five or six times. There is an odd \"wow\" falloff at the end of \"These Days\". Sounds like the engineer stopped the turntable manually.Jennifer Warnes was obviously not involved in the creation of this compilation. Too uneven, badly mastered.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: This \"Review\" Will Not Be Helpful: Is Jennifer Warnes doomed to do movie music to make a few bucks?

This single taken from their first album \"Wide Open Spaces\" is much more \"country\" than \"Earl\", but there is a charm and optimism in the song that your \"troubles\" are likely to seem less burdening after listening to it.\"Am I the Only One\" written by Maria McKee is a fine up-beat country-ballad also taken from the album.The remix-version of \"There's Your Trouble\" is good, but the remix doesn't really add anything to the original version which is just great as it is.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Monster memories: Good Copy of orginal score.The Wolfman is the stronger of the tracks here though Son of Frankenstein is not in the same class as the music from The Bride of Frankenstein is still invokes great moments from the movie.Great for collectors even if they are not horror fans.The Wolfman tracks from the film are the first to be recorded and also includes music that was wrote but never used in the finished movie.Listening to the music from the DVD realeases of the films, you would find it hard pressed to tell the difference if any.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: A Great Find!: It is fantastic for me, as for any huge Universal Horror fan, to find the wonderful music of Frank Skinner available on CD. Since I was a child watching these movies, I've always thought that Skinner's strings added enormously to the thrill factor in the Holmes series,'The Wolfman', 'Son of Frankenstein', etc. The instantly recognizable Universal Studio opening theme always made me run to see what was on.

Ms. Venker writes so articulately regarding many of the thoughts I have had as a mother, but didn't know how to express. She is thoughtful in her comments and very honest. She doesn't portray motherhood as being totally blissful, but does express the importance of actually parenting your children once you decide to have them. She helps us to realize that, as we have more and more choices in our lives, there are always repercussions to our choices. We need to make sure that our children's needs are our first priority as we make our choices. We can \"have it all\", but maybe not all at the same time.

This is complete drivel. There are thousands of happy children of working moms (myself included) who would disagree with the author that working moms somehow can't be good mothers.Furthermore, this is classic Michelle Bachmann hypocrisy. If the author truly believes that women are best off staying at home and washing dishes, perhaps she shouldn't be writing a book.

Ever notice the lack of books written by working moms who criticize stay at home moms? They're generally too busy applying themselves to better pursuits.I'm a part-time working mom who is proud to set an example for my daughter. She won't be anyone's handmaiden in life.

There's little factual basis to what they say.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Piece of garbage!: The title says it all! I will no longer listen to Dr. Laura nor the anti-working mommy ideals that the author professes! How is it that Dr. Laura works?

All of the scary elements that I was hoping for were there, and the pace drew me in immediately. But as the book went on I became annoyed at first, and gradually frustrated with the character's complete lack of brains.As bad things start to go down, the characters seem to want to do everything except for the obvious - leave. There is nothing that really forces anyone in this story to stay where they are at, and as the death toll mounts and creepy goings on get more sinister, it never seems to cross any ones mind that the simplest solution would be to find a nicer neighborhood. It is like there is a Masterton IQ Reduction Chip (tm) lodged inside each character's head!And as silly as that sounds, had the author used a gimmick like this to explain the stupidity of his characters, I probably could have enjoyed the narrative enough to have given it 3.5-4 stars instead of 1.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: HPL would be spinning: This book is okay, but Brown Jenkin is not what I saw when I read HPL's \"Dreams in the Witch House.\"It's not a good Masterton book, either.

With a high budget hot Devo-esque video for the new millenium and Kylie looking as though she hasn't aged a day.

If you are looking to study for the GRE, I recommend picking up the Harcourt Brace College Outline Series books on College Chemistry and Physical Chemistry if you haven't already. If you want a book to study for organic chemistry, try finding a Kaplan MCAT book on organic chemistry, or at least one that has an organic chemistry section. As for instrumentation and inorganic, go back and ask friends or reread your notes and textbooks.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: sloppy: The topics covered are generally clear, but there are numerous errors and typos. There are bonds missing in the organic chemistry section and at least one error that is of a seriously confusing sort.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Wish I could give zero stars: Avoid this book at all costs. It contains numerous errors, misleading items, and misspellings.

Although the majority of this book is pictures (very nice ones at that), there are some very interesting facts and historical information about the victorian card craze. Because there are in excess of 100,000 different cards in existance, don't expect to find every card in here or the current market price. It is just a matter of time before a more extensive guide is published, (I would still recommend because of the great illustrations!) The only problem I have with this book is the layout which can be annoying if you are trying to find info on one of your cards. You have to search through several sections of the book. (e.g. Jackson's chewing tobbaco card in the \"Exploration and Travel\" chapter instead of the \"Tobbaco\" chapter). More expensive cards are usually only discussed in the chapter rather than illustrated, which I find kind of strange(Maybe he didn't own any of those to get the photo?).\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.63)\n","\n","Review: Lavishly illustrated, marvelous reference...: This is a great book. It's a definitive reference on the somewhat obscure subject of Victorian Trade Cards, but for those of us who love them, it's a feast. It is crammed with illustrations, broken into categories, and contains history and collecting tips. The pricing information is somewhat out of date, due to the impact that online auctions have had on these collectables (some are more expensive, some less, as auctions make them more available.) If you're at all a fan of this genre, don't hesitate to buy this book!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.98)\n","\n","Review: Victorian Trade Cards: Historical Reference and Value Guide: A wonderfully written book on the topic of Victorian trade cards.

He simply opened the mouth to set it and it wouldn't lock open so the teeth could be played. When an adult tried to get it to set, it was obvious the racheting mechanism was faulty. Return it? No, it cost less than $10 and would cost nearly that to get it in the mail(wrapping supplies, drive time and gas to get it to the post office).

I thought it would be bigger then it is so it ended up being a stocking stuffer but it is still super fun. It ended up being a good size because we can put it in a backpack to take on trips or to the doctors office to him occupied. The best part of the game is the anticipation on when it is going to snap closed adds to the excitement.

Be prepared: the top jaw slams down on your finger, and while my son doesn't cry (it doesn't really hurt so much as it surprises you), he does yell \"ouch\" ...And then continues playing with it. The tooth that makes the crocodile \"bite\" is random so you never know which one it'll be. The game goes quickly and can be fun for the entire family, which is nice when it's so hard to find games that not only appeal to the whole family, but can be played by families with age ranges from preschool children to older adults. It's a great way to squeeze a family game in on a busy weeknight.

It's a good idea to demo the game first to show them what happens (and the unpredictability).

And sometimes not all the teeth stay down so we're not sure if they're supposed to stay down or rebound back up. The spring inside makes a weird clicking sound so I'd assume it's broken.

From the photos that I saw, I assumed that the toy would be bigger then it actually was. It is small, about the size of my fist. The idea of the game is to keep pressing teeth until you reach the sore one, at which time the jaw will snap shut. However, the jaw very frequently pops off completely when snapping shut and requires an adult to put it back together. The teeth often do not reset after the jaw has snapped shut and have to be manually pried back into position to be able to play again.

China replica.: I'm very upset after receiving my \"Crocodile Dentist\" game. Once I got it out of the Amazon box, I realized right away that this was not the game made by Hasbro sold in the US. It's very obvious just from looking at the game box, which is cheap, says \"CrocoDileDentist\" on it, and is full of oddly-phrased sentences with typos, punctuation errors, and grammer mistakes. The toy does work, but it is VERY cheaply made. If I wanted this toy, I could have gone to alibaba.com and ordered one from China myself for 1.75. Instead I paid 11 dollars for the REAL toy, and got this one. As another reviewer said, it does have a \"used\" look about it right out of the package. Especially on the bottom of the toy. I am very disapointed. I've never had an experience like this on Amazon, and I've bought hundreds of items.

Unlike the double-vinyl release of the same show, this DVD rendering sounds like it was recorded thorugh a telephone. The DVD is, in fact, an excellent document of historical stuffs, but it suffers as a source of entertainment. The sound is simply terrible (although dated, one would think better sound could be mixed in here). Purchase only if you are a die-hard Bowie fan (like myself). If you don't know Bowie, don't start here!\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Bowie and Ronson - nothing more need be said!: I have to chuckle at the perfectionists that diss this DVD because of the video quality. Folks, it was filmed in 1973! Nothing was as technically good then as it is now. And the style of filming IS dated, I agree. But take this for what it is - the ONLY film document of one of the major moments in rock history - Bowie performing with the original Spiders From Mars as his gender-bending Ziggy Stardust persona. Add the fact that it is maybe the only recorded document of Mick Ronson live, and what more could you want?! (OK, I'm a guitarist, and Ronson is one of my guitar heroes, and so I guess I am biased). But really - what an incredible performance! Bowie and Ronson - it just doesn't get much better than that...\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Classic Bowie and Ronson: This is one cool but dated video. It contains some of the only video of Mick Ronson, deceased, available. It also chronicles the Ziggy Stardust tour which was huge for Bowie in his cross dressing era. It's really good if you excuse the fact it was shot with less than top of the line gear. It still gives the vibe and I do recommend it to anyone who loves Bowie during this time. This is really some of his best work in a time when many people didn't know what to make of him.Get it, set back, and wonder.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: glam rock at it's best: A great representation of the era of glam rock as created by Bowie.

A necessary addition to your video music catalog.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: I'm a hardcore early David Bowie fan BUT: This concert film stinks! The camerawork is worse than clumsy--it looks like something a spastic with a Handicam would have done. And the sound quality is horrible.

It appears to be a pathetically low-budget production, a pity considering that it was done by the same man, D.A. Pennebaker, who wonderfully documented Bob Dylan's 1965 British tour in \"Don't Look Back\" (1967). As it is, the sound quality of this Ziggy Stardust performance is quite poor, as if all the mics were positioned 250 yards away from the stage. Moreover, the camera work is at times annoyingly erratic and inappropriate. The whole production, strangely, reeks of amateurism. If this movie would have been made with, for example, the production quality of Led Zeppelin's \"The Song Remains the Same,\" it would be well worth watching. Unfortunately, the bizarre sight of Bowie himself in action is its only saving grace.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Where in the world is the original mix?: I have not seen nor heard the DVD release of this work but I have the VHS version. What a terrible injustice to the concert! I remember watching the concert on \"In Concert\" way back in the 70's. I even audio taped it on cassett, as it was aired on radio at the same time. No, the stupid echo effects were not on that version, Mick Ronson's guitar work (I miss that guy), was in front and smokin'! Who thought of mixing Ronson's ax just about out of the concert in the first place. To top it all off, Jeff Beck came out near the end of the show and played Jean Jeanie with the band An unbelivable walk on, just blew the roof off the place, you would never know it though since it is left off all video productions.Does anyone know when the REAL VERSION (What was released for the \"In Concert\" show on ABC) production would come out. It must be somewhere.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A nice DVD: I have this on both DVD and video and there isn't that much difference. DVD you can skip the guitar solos though and get back to David... or pause perfectly. If you do buy a DVD though, make sure you don't have the surround sound on. It sounds much much better when it's just flat together. Although this isn't a concert like you'd see today, it's still entertaining, definitely a classic. Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders just go together. I've got friends that don't know Bowie, but do know Ziggy Stardust. This is a great band, wonderful character, wonderful songs, it all comes together despite the picture quality. You can definitely just put it on and watch it, or work on something and just listen to it. It is worth the buy, especially if you love David Bowie.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: disappointing: One of the first DVDs I ordered and of those first few, the one I most looked forward to. But, after making all the adjustments I could think of I could not make the sound (or video for that matter) quality acceptable.

I have videos that come up 100% better, Why produce DVDs that dont qualify for this technology? it\"s not the first and it won't be the last, DVD producers please don't bother putting visual crap out on DVD, your transfers are unworthy of modern technology, if the Masters don't scrub up for transfer forget it, although a lot of people cant see any difference, so be it.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Camera work not 100% but great music all the same.: I admit to the fact that the camera work is not ALL that wonderful.

No one has ponies, the other girls are rude and the owner is snobby. Her daughter is secretive and always upset. Then the pony pals find out that Shelly (the lady's daughter) once owned a pony, but everyone always pressured her to trade her pony for a horse and go to lots of shows. Then the pony died and no one was upset but her. Angry with everyone, she decides not to ride again. Can the pony pals help her and her mother? Read the book and find out!!

She is American, I'm a Scot and, at first, I wondered why she was sending me a book called Inheriting Scotland. Then it dawned on me, my friend was one of the authors of the series of interconnected stories which make up this book.On boxing day I sat down and read the book and I can say - and this from one who is steeped in Scottish folklore - that I enjoyed it immensely. All of the different authors jell together so well that the tale seems seamless. Of course I enjoyed Janet's contribution, but also I thought that that 'The Inheritance' episodes were very well done, and held the book together, and I also very much enjoyed 'The Corbie's Nest' and 'The Luck of the Sixpence'.I thoroughly recommend this book to all readers with a love of Scotland, and a bit of mystery, intrigue and romance.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Not as expected: Don't be fooled by the title this book has nothing to do with the Stock Market.

The same at the end of chapter 12, where Goodwill promises a Chapter on integrating the XML Apache Soap project into Tomcat.

There is no attempt to go beyond the surface. It seems the author was in a rush to get a book published, rather than spend time providing some insight into Tomcat.There is no proper introduction to the terms or concepts related to Tomcat. I don't expect an introduction to servlets or JSP.

It's bad enough that this information comes at nearly the end of the book. What's worse, the integration chapter is only a few pages long, and goes no further (in fact, doesn't even go as far) as the documentation that's provided online.This book is a huge disappointment - you are far better served by picking up a good O'Reilly book on servlets/JSP/etc. and figuring out the Tomcat installation/webapp deployment issues on your own.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Good only for the beginners.: This book is good only for the beginner.

Thus it is with cinematic satire as this film won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. There is no story of any worth here. It adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition (which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies) per se, it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment. McKellan and Redgrave do their best, but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d'etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer. That it won an Oscar for the screenplay says far more about the Academy's often appalling decisions than anything else. Perhaps, like the American Presidency, lobby money can buy anything.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Yes, this is a lame=weird movie: 1. one may try to impress others by talking up this artsy fartsy movie, but the intellectually honest will realize that this movie is just... lame.2. the acting is stilted and so unrealistic and of course--> the storyline is just bizarre. but of course, the self-indulgent and narcissistic love unusual storylines so as to fool the general public.3. at the end of the day, dismiss the high brow critics and realize this movie for what it is--> an odd / bizarre movie with surprisingly lame acting.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: God, This Movie's A Monster!: Yawn, yawn, yawn!

What a waste of two hours. Academy Award nominations? PLEEEEEEEASE! For what?

I was ready and willing to be proven wrong about my negative impression of Brendan Fraser's acting ability, based on what others had said of this film, but ended up with further confirmation that he is a lousy actor. I ordinarily like movies that are slow moving and antithetical to shoot-em-up blockbusters, but this picture C...R...A...W...L...E...D..., and suffered from dry dialogue, to boot. On top of everything else, this film was predictable, and I continued watching only to see if a fantastic surprise ending would redeem it. No dice- the end certainly did not justify the tedious means.In addition to a badly written script and substandard acting, the actors' accents seemed overdone (too theatric) and fake. It was a real drag to watch this movie.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Yuck!: I never would have bought this except that I lost the copy I naively borrowed from the library, and I needed a replacement copy.

This movie was ingenious, and if you liked it, definitely read \"Father of Frankenstein.\"\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Tender, wonderful movie: I can't go on & on in quadruple paragraphs like some reviewers do, but I can say that this movie touched me & brought tears to my eyes several times.

The ending is bittersweet...you felt that the Brendan Fraser character would never know such a friendship again.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: An intense and powerful Drama!: I purchased this movie because I am a huge Brendan Fraser fan, but the movie is so moving that I somewhat forgot that Brendan was in it and became so captivated in the story, that I ended up watching it again a second time. It is wonderfully acted! I think it's Brendan's best work ever and Ian Mckellen is outstanding in this movie. For anyone looking for a movie that will move you and having you wanting friends and family to see it, this one will. It's such a powerful drama. One that I will watch over and over.

The photography is excellent. Script--wonderful.

If you know something about James Whale or liked his movies then it will prove more interesting. The movie starts out a bit slow but then grabs you and doesn't let go until the end, but fascinating throughout. I was surprised that the gay subject-matter did not make me feel uncomfortable (as with other similarly-themed movies). Expert performances by Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave make this all the more rewarding. See this movie. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie an 8!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: I know I was supposed to be impressed, but....: This movie just didn't grab me, at any point. I am usually a tremendous fan of McKellan's work, and like Fraser's style. However, neither really clinched it in this film. The scene stealer in this blasé film has to be Redgrave, playing McKellan's Hungarian housekeeper. The film covers the recollections of the director of the original Frankenstein film. McKellen finds a confidante in Fraser, the yard/pool boy. While the recollections could have been riveting, somehow the delivery is flat, and you find yourself saying \"who cares?\" most of the time, without forming any affinity for either character's plight. Yes, McKellen is an openly gay actor, and yes, Fraser does a bit of a nude scene, but that's no reason to run out and buy this film. Rent it on a slow Saturday afternoon. It's watchable, but you won't want to re-watch it.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: A truly poignant, touching film: This is a fabulous movie adapted from a wonderful book. Both are worth purchasing. The novel is called \"Father of Frankenstein,\" by Christopher Bram. I read (and loved) the book before seeing the movie, and initially, I was hesitant to see the film version at all. So many film adaptations of great books excise the heart and soul of the original. But I was convinced to see the movie and was very pleasantly surprised. It is subtle, touching, and poignant. To sum it up: this movie is simply well written, well directed, well made, and especially well acted. Do yourself a favor and see this movie -- it is truly touching. But first, read the book. Both will impress you.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: More than perfect: This movie is a masterpiece. IMHO, it is flawless in every aspect. Words cannot describe how wonderful these actors are. Ian McKellen has definitely dominated the show. He is like a beautiful centerpiece that is made of diamond. I couldn't move my eyes away from him. And Brendan Fraser is equally good; his strength is not a bit weaker than his counterpart. That is admirable. Finally, Lynn Redgrave, she has shone through the whole movie. She's perfect. The story telling is magically, the director, the screenwriter, the musician; the whole production team has done an incredible work to bring this tragedy story to live. These people are brilliant; they know their stuff; they know life; there is no doubt about that. What amazes me is that they also have a loving heart and that makes this movie extra special.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A Wonderful Synergy of Pure Talent: This film is as poignant now as it was when I first saw it in '99, and am very glad to own it on DVD as one of my favourites. The settings, costume styles, and score make it worth seeing second from the brilliant script and performances by such great actors as Sir Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, and sadly missed Lynn Redgrave (RIP). This is a truly correct blend of talent that is reminiscent of another film released that year, \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\", as well as many of the classics. Great art makes me cry, as this film's end did in '99, and still does today. If you are interested in classic films, and high intellectual art, this DVD is for you. I should like to have it on Blu-ray.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: good: I have to say the movie was much better then I expected it to be..I really enjoyed the ending and the meaning behind him befriending a \"strong type \" guy...get this movie..u wont be disappointed!!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Kevin Bacon: As usual, Kevin Bacon does a great job playing someone who is not such a nice guy yet he manages to give his character some humanity.

Also Amazon should have noted this DVD is not a regular DVD release but a DVD-R cheaply made movie.

It moved quickly, but thoroughly...a very enjoyable read. Although the term \"page-turner\" is cliché, that's what this is.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Excellent Biography: An engrossing, informative biography of baseball's greatest player. Some biographers make the mistake of rattling off facts and statistics, as if to impress you with how much research they've done. Creamer wisely focuses on the story, including descriptions of important games that make you feel like you're on the field with the Babe. Comments by Ruth's contemporaries add to the realism. \"Babe\" gets off to a slow start--a chapter dealing with Creamer's feelings about writing the book, and more details about Ruth's childhood than you probably want to know. But once Ruth starts playing baseball, the book grabs you and won't let go. One caveat: the discussion of Ruth's womanizing, while necessary and not extensive, makes this book inappropriate for young readers. If you like baseball and want to learn more about Babe Ruth, this is the book to get.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.75)\n","\n","Review: Still The Best: Originally published in 1974, Creamer's book was the first \"serious\" biography of Ruth and remains the standard work on the subject. The first few chapters are a bit slow as the author painstakingly chips away at decades of apocrypha and rumor to reconcile the many conflicting accounts of the Babe's youth. The pace picks up once Ruth reaches the big leagues and really takes off after he's sold to the Yankees. Creamer is frank about the Babe's ravenous appetites and the effect these had on those around him, notably his first wife. Ultimately, Ruth comes off as a jovial, well-meaning but rather selfish man who was fun to be around but not someone you'd want to depend on.This Kindle edition has a hyperlinked table of contents and index but contains no photographs save the cover.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Babe: The Legend Comes To Life: As author of the yet to be published \"Babe Ruth: The Man Behind The Legend,\" I have read every book I can find on the subject of Babe Ruth.

This one is, by far, the best of all and I keep it with me at all times when I am in need of reference material. It is the most thorough and comprehensive.

I did not really know to much about him, even being a big American League baseball fan.It is amazing to read some of the stories how he was difficult, may not have said things the way he should have, and how he was not always a good player, well little mistakes. But then on the other hand, how he was kind of like a big kid.The author I feel did an excellent job in writing this book from beginning to end. At some points he might not have the whole story for earlier years, but he did use newspapers, ect for play by play of some of the games.It is interesting to learn about how he interacted with other players and owners. It is kind of sad how his later years ended up and I believe more modern players are taken care of a little more in their later years.So much info in this book and well written. I learned a lot and highly recommend this book.Mike\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Still the Sultan: I really enjoyed this book.

For example accomplishments of the Buffalo Soldiers and the network of the Underground Railroad.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Very Nice Watch for exceptional price: Purchased this watch to wear to a semi-formal party to coordinate with my white gold and diamond accessories.

I thought to myself, why do I need one more? I originally took this book out from my local library and enjoyed it so much I wanted to buy it to have it for permanent reference. It covers everything from soil (how and when to test), to all types of plants (flowers, herbs, shrubs,etc). The illustrations are many and help visually guide the reader with steps for things like pruning, staking, composting, etc. The tips are simple and are environmentally friendly.

But even worse, there are huge psychological flaws here... Flat characters.. Unrealistic portrait of a mother's grief .. and an ending that is so out of touch with the mother's reality.. It's just too light and doesn't , as so many books seem not to, deliver on its initial promise... Yet, on the positive side, the scenes are vivid, memorable and ditto some of the characters.. But that beginning was SO promising.. that the rest drops you into sadness.. not about the death portrayed but about the value of a great story that doesn't begin to meet its promise.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: This wallows in lameness!: The title of the review says it all.

However, I would have loved to have know Sarah more before her accident. Her character was not fully developed. I liked her best male friend the best. I found the other characters self-absorbed and often annoying. The overall plot was interesting and often heart-wrenching.

Meg Wolitzer's writing is all-American, a reflection of life here and now. I love it. She's just deep enough to be very interesting, and literary enough to pull you along, but in this book, every word counts. If only every women's author these days was so spare and so talented! It was such a relief to pick up this meaty but relatively short book - 240 pages - after having to plow through big, fat, 500-page, comment-on-every-color-and-nuance-of-thought \"women's literature\" books for my book club!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Boring,Boring,Boring,,,: How an author can create such great characters while writing a novel free from compelling circumstances is surprising. Ho hum, I can't believe she's dead, let's pour ourself another drink. I can't believe her mother showed up, ho-hum let's pour another drink and watch her clean the house. One big secret does surface, but it is rather mundane in it's telling. At the end everyone gets better, while the Mom who is easily the most exciting of the group, realizes life does go on after the loss of a child. Even if'ts is a miserable and shallow existence.

When one of the humans fell prey, I thought 'so what'...when one of the vampires was being high and mighty, I thought 'whatever'. Having the vampires turn into a grotesque, ugly beast is orginal, but actually rather distasteful. It did have a lot of surprise twists to the plot, which saved it from being awful, but I won't read it again, and I won't keep the book. My biggest complaint is that no one could resist the draw of vampirism...what absolutely no one?

Damion Kirk is a master story weaver and first class writer with tremendous style. Mr. Kirk's vampires are so vivid, they crawl off the page. One even followed me into my dreams! St. Laurue is a vampire that shocks as much with his violence as his sudden outbursts of mercy.That Mr. Kirk has created such memorable characters is wonderful, that they share such a rich story is incredible. Reflections of a Vampire entices us on a wild romp from the back alleys and clubs of NYC, to the Holocaust Museum in DC.I'll put it this way - If you're looking for a great read; if you love horror, mystery or suspense -- buy one for yourself, and one for your best friend - so they don't keep yours. Why did I love Reflections of a Vampire? Because it's a tale so very, very human.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Big Chill in Little London: A word of mouth film. In turn sordid, fascinating, voyeuristic and sensational. The filmmakers take the wake theme and give it a new twist. From beyond the grave, Jude Law narrates and shows a film of his friends to his friends. They are shown as cowards, cheats, petty criminals, adulterers and ultimately murderers. The end is a shocker. The acting superb, in that \"fly on the wall\" documentary style. Ray Whinstone steals most of his scenes. Check him out in Sexy Beast and Final Orders.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A little disappointed...: Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? Sure, it was an original idea and the revelation of how Jude died was surprising, to say the least. Still, it was very slow-moving and even though Ray Whinstone was very good and Jude Law looked as hot as ever, there wasn't much else to hold my attention. The female leads all acted as if this were the first time they had read their lines - Sadie Frost, in my opinion, was terrible! Surely they could have found some actresses who would show a little emotion and seem sincere when they did show a little emotion. So, I give this film kudos for such an original idea and the unique way in which it was filmed and presented, but otherwise, I have to give it two thumbs down :-(\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: For those who like word of mouth cult movies...: and especially British underground cult movies, check out \"Final Cut\" - and then \"Love, Honour & Obey\" (the sequel, written by the same two guys, and featuring the same set of actors). The first time I saw \"Final Cut\" back in 98 I was gripped by the edgy, rawness of this \"reality movie\" format, and the shear thought-provoking nature of the film. (I mean, who can you really trust..?) One of the reasons I think the film works so well is because the actors (in both movies) are all friends in real life and part of what's called the \"Primrose Hill\" set. Note too that the characters all take the names of the actors. For those who are Ray Winstone and Jude Law fans, these early performances helped launched their careers and rightly so. A great movie (if you don't have to be entertained by non-stop action, special effects, etc. and you can understand the dialogue and accents!).\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Trash Pure and Simple: This is one of the worst conceived, plotted, edited, or acted films it has ever been my misfortune to buy.

Each of the bears are rattles and are not only interesting to watch but noisy too. However, the suction cup doesn't work very well, even when moistened. I used to put it on our baby's swing tray, and then her high chair tray, but it never stuck for long and would fall over. Obviously it's quite top-heavy, so it's not a toy that is made to be HELD and played with.Occasionally I will still try it on her high chair tray but now she's strong enough that (because it doesn't stick well) she can knock it to the floor. Mostly it just sits in her toy box and doesn't get any play.My recommendation? If you're looking for a suction cup toy, try something else.

I heard that kids have liked this book and it seems more written for teenagers than adults, but there's not a lot to recommend.

What I got was disappointing, to say the least. At minimum, this book is mistitled, because the reader is led to expect a comprehensive description about how executive teams function and create the same kind of magic we find with teams elsewhere in the organization. Instead, we are treated to page after page of exhortation, warning against a) calling an executive team a \"real team\"; b) encouraging CEOs to create \"real\" executive \"teams\" and c) permitting \"undisciplined\" teamwork at the top, lest senior executives suddenly drink the kumbya-flavored Kool-Aid of too much collaborative behavior.

It held such promise of addressing one of the most important barriers to building collaborative behavior in organizations---the behavior of the senior people.Throughout the book the author seemed to defend the hierarchical behavior of senior executives and diminish team benefits.

Phrases such as \"amorphous groups with overlapping responsibilities,\" \"disrupt the natural order of things,\" \"seldom the best way to get normal work accomplished or routine problems solved,\" \"seldom the fastest way for a group with an experienced, capable leader to get where they are going,\" \"time-consuming 'forming, norming, and storming' stuff,\" had me wondering if the author really understands collaboration.This book may do more to maintain the traditional topdown, hierarchical decision making model than to foster real collaboration and teamwork.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Good Godowsky.: These are good performances, but I prefer those of Carlo Grante on Music & Arts.

What an incredible harmony between him and his highly talented keyboardist Chester Thompson. This Thompson guy is absolutely genious, and the two together consist the heart and soul of the band. Just listen to the organ improvising theme of OYE COMO VA, EVIL WAYS and SOUL SACRIFICE, and you'll understand what I mean. No underestimation of other band members.. All of them are great. I rated the band 5 stars, and Arista company which produced the DVD 3 stars making a mean of 4 stars for the item. I can't believe how to produce a music DVD on the end of 2005 without a 5.1 channel sound format.I think that great Santana deserves to be listened at his utmost,and the DVD shouldn't be produced with only stereo sound. This DVD is a must for any Santana fan, good for both price and music content.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Nutritious and delicious: Though one reviewer felt the format of this book was a poor choice, I found it to be perfect. I can leave a spare copy with one of my grocery bags so that I can pick out a new recipe or two while at the grocery store. I find that this lets me find the freshest foods available.What I like most about this book is that with a little preperation and fore thought, you can do much of your cooking for meals in advance, and just combine ingredients and heat when meal time comes. This can be done because many of the recipes call for \"cooked rice\" or \"cooked peas\". I find that this also allows you to use leftovers up quickly, in new recipes.One note, though, is that this book is not Vegan by any means. Many of the recipes call for dairy products and eggs.Overall, it is a lovely lovely book and a must for those trying to live lightly on the earth.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Recipes for a Small Planet: Great book for vegetarian recipes. Great for a new vegetarian oranyone who enjoys meatless recipes.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Nearly Useless: I've owned this cookbook for years. A well-meaning relative gave it to me when I first became a vegetarian 16 years ago, and it's a good thing that I didn't start to try recipes from this book early on, because I would have given up on vegetarianism. There are some decent bread recipes here, but the remainder are almost uniformly terrible. Nutritious, perhaps, but also tasteless without a seeming thought to presentation or texture. This book represents the worst of early vegetarian cooking in America, and I have yet to prepare a single recipe from this book that I found to be truly appetizing, or that I would (heaven forbid) serve to guests. I didn't sell my copy because I wouldn't inflict this sort of thing on an unsuspecting victim - I recycled my copy.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Bought it again for our second child!: These Carters baby albums are very cute, high quality, and easy to use.

AnneMarie, a beautiful, 17-year-old underachiever, has been put on an academic contract and will not graduate with her high-school class - to her dismay. When she attends a tabernacle meeting led by Brother Jackson, a charismatic, handsome self-proclaimed minister, she becomes a true Christian. After discovering she is pregnant with Brother Jackson's child, she turns to him for help, and he takes her to a spiritual redemption camp to find guidance.

She shared this with my son. Little did she know that this curious toy would be such a hit. My son loved it. I had to go buy two for us -- one for him and one to share, so he could have water wars. We took them to a lagoon with some friends and the kids all took to it right away.It's a water canon, a bullhorn, a funnel, and even a strange device that the kids rigged up to pull a body board around. This is durable, with a lot of play value for toddlers up to teens. Well, if you want it played with as intended (pull cone down large side first and water flies out the other end), they'd have to be at least 6 years old -- younger kids have problems doing it. The water can shoot quite high, if they do it right. But even if they can't make it shoot, the kids will figure out something to do with it.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Put holes in our pool liner: We loved this toy at first . . .great fun!

This book was very good, and I read it a few years ago during a class that I had to take. Everyone had read the Diary of Anne Frank, but although this includes excerpts of hers, I was interested to know what others thought. Whether or not they were as optimistic as she was. If you are looking for a read that will give you different perspectives on how teenagers thought about the Holocaust, this is the book for you.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: I don't like it: IT WAS SOOOOO BORING. no action at all.

I belive that the book had to many narriations and really didn't see it through the eyes of the teenagers. The book was informative but it lacked the feeling of the Holocaust. The book did tell of the deaths of the teenagers but it did't bring out the feelings that I expected. Over all it was an so so book.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: This is a good book: I am a sixth and I'm reading a book about five teenagers who died in the Holocaust. the first diary is about a teenager named David Rubinowicz and his diary is called \"The end of the world will soon be here\".Yitzak Rubasheuski is the second diary of the book and his diary is called \"Long live the youth!\" Moshe Flinker is the third of this book and his diary is called \"My name is Harry\". Eva Heyan's is the fourth diary and her diary is called \"I want to live!\"Ann frank is the last diary of the book and her diary is called \"I must uphold my Ideals\". The reason I didn't wright anything about what happened is because I don't want to spoil the story for you. I liked this book because of the detials. The only bad part is that all the teenagers died.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Ok I guess: This book was OK. I had to read it for school but I agree that it had way too many narrations in it and the only thing that captured the teens' feelings and thoughts were the scant entries from their diaries.

If the author had put more of the kids' entries in it, it might be more effective.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Book=Very GOOD!: I thought this book was very good and descriptive in what happened to the teenager's lives and the victims of the Holocaust. It was sad to know how well-off Americans in the U.S. and other fortunate people had it then. When I was reading, it was sad to picture how hard it would be then for not just teenagers but everyone,especially when they talked about how they didn't want to die yet and the shame and humiliation they felt as jews. I liked how Boas described their lives and events so well that I didn't feel I missed out anywhere. I also liked how he would compare the teenagers lives and choices with the others. But I would have liked it more if he would have described more about what the Nazis would do to the victims after they were transported.

He addresses race, drugs, crime, social inequality, gender, and many other relevant issues. I found his assessment of these issues superficial often misapplying or incorrectly citing material referenced. His ideology is readily apparent, and throughout most of the book influences his discussion of the issues. Instead of taking an objective and critical look at our social problems, he embarked on a one-sided journey of his personal opinion.

It explained the complete history of Airedales. However, past page 32, they did not even mention \"Airedale\" (it was only written in the captions).

The film is quite entertaining if you take into consideration the inclusion of a fictitious German agent, added because, when the film was made, the fact that the allies had broken the German Enigma codes was not public information. The film had to give some explanation as to how the allies knew that the Germans swallowed the deception and relocated their defences away from Sicily. A fuller and more up to date account is in \"Operation Mincemeat\" which has the benefit of 60 years of additional research.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A Dead Hero!: This has got to be one of the best WWII espionage films I have seen. Clifton Webb as Montagu did a credible job portraying the mastermind of the plan to sidetrack the Germans.

Why can't movies be made like this anymore? Recent World War II movies are not accurate and place too much emphasis on effects. In my opinion, the more \"special effects\" a movie has, the more fake it is. Anyhow, \"The Man Who Never Was\" describes the true events of the British trying to confuse the Germans as to where the Allies will invade - Sicily or Greece. By arranging to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain with top-secret documents, the British cause the Germans to alter their defenses, thus saving the Allies from suffering even more casualties. How the British found a body, the details that they had to come up with to make the Germans believe the body was for real, and the subsequent German effort to determine whether or not the information found on the body was accurate, all make for an exciting story which moves at a swift pace. This is really a great World War II movie.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Incredibly slow, boring thriller based on a fascinating true story: I couldn't make it past the first ten minutes.

No suspense, just boring dialogue between cardboard actors. Clifton Webb and the glorious Gloria Graham (in a bit part) couldn't save this belatedly patriotic and badly produced, low-budget film.

I'm a third-year Mech Eng student. I've taken plenty of classes on hard subjects, so I know when a text book just plain sucks. This book does a pathetic job of explaining examples and basic concepts. I've spent hours trying to figure out assumptions that they should have just mentioned in the first place. And the poorly explained examples don't prepare you for the actual chapter problems. Because of the \"wordy\" writing style of the authors, basic concepts sound more complicated than they actually are; getting through the reading is a slow and tedious process.The book is utterly sterile. The only colors you'll see inside it are black and a little blue; there isn't even a picture of an actual circuit in this book. It's like it's writen for a machine.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Not good: This book is not very helpful! It needs better examples and more info.

Also, I ordered the hardcover edition of this book, yet amazon in it's infinite wisdom (or is that total stupidity) sent me the softcover edition. Three weeks into the course and the binding is failing. Can't return the book because I need to have it in class, and I refuse to spend more money with a company that is unable to fulfill a simple order. Amazon, you suck at least as much as this book does! Perhaps Barnes and Noble will know the difference between hardcover and softcover.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Hidden Gem!!: After listening to tracks off this CD on KKSF in San Francisco 15 years ago, I decided to search high and low for one of the last albums on the Columbia label by the jazz piano legend. I finally found a used version in a second hand book store for 5 bucks! It was worth the wait. \"My Love Leads You Home\" & \"Shamballa\" are the highlights on this 7 track CD, which I wish could have been longer.

People with sexual addictions are not going to be helped by such bible-thumping judgments. So much talk of sin will only lead to more shame, not less. As Schaumburg recognizes that shame is such a large part of sexual addiction, you would think he would have avoided such heavy-handednessBesides, one has to assume that anyone bothering to read such a book already knows he/she has a problem. If they don't know, this will probably not convince them - it will only make them tune Shaumburg out as a throw-back to the '50s. It really is too bad, because the section concerning how to prevent sexual addiction in their child is very good.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: False Intimacy has false determinations about God & sex: This book was a complete turnoff. Instead of relating to scientific, psycological explanations of sexual addiction, the author blames everything on lack of closeness with God and not being saved by Jesus Christ. This author could use a good shrink. Take respondsibilty for your actions. Is God or the absense of him respondsible for everything. What a crank. Buy this book and go to seminary school. What a waste of time and money. Pure garbage. Now I need to buy another book to find out about my sexual addiction (psycologically) not spiritually.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: An abomination: I'm a Stanford-trained MD and practicing psychiatrist and I have to say that this book is worse than terrible.

Dr. Shaumburg is definitely serving Jesus Christ with this book and is following Christ's calling in his life. From the original sin of Adam and Eve until now, man will always deal with sin hear on Earth, but Dr. Shaumburg offers wonderful Christian insight into the specific topic of different behavoirs we become involved in trying to fill a place in our heart that only Jesus' Holy Spirit can fill. The key is be submissive to Jesus' Holy Spirit.Awesome book!!!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Average sound and vision , music slick but involving: Most of Roxy's fans will buy all their DVD's as each of them offers a different lineup of the band and different songs .This lineup had an exceptional rhythm section , who help give the songs a lift and they make me want to watch and listen again and again .One gets a good idea of how mellow Roxy could be as the ballads are convincingly done , with stirring lead work by Neil Hubbard on MY ONLY LOVE being the highpoint of a standout version .A good release - maybe one day they will be able to clean up the picture .

I first came across this group in the flamenco movie \"El Amor Brugo\" - the original classic music is composed by De Falla, a Spanish composer. Via Amazon I was able to purchase 4 albums by Azucar Moreno. The Exitos Originales album has the true Flamenco pop music - it also features the song \"Azucar Moreno\" that appears in the movie I spoke of. The other tracks are similar in nature and could have been part of that movie. This makes the album vary Flamenco balanced.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Handy lil mp3 player: I bought the 512mb for my daughter. It's big enough (drive wise) for her favorite songs and small enough (compact wise)she can take it with her instead of a portable cd player when we travel.

But the excecution leaves a lot to be desired. The problem is that, while the album has the trappings of surf music, it doesn't feel like \"real\" surf music. Probably because \"The Wave Benders\" aren't a real surf group. The album was recorded by a bunch of studio musicians in Amsterdam, of all places. So, what we have here is an album of generic \"surf music\" versions of Christmas songs.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Delivers what it promises.: Mr. Erwin's book delivers what the title promises, \"Creative Projects.\" From cool ideas for the kids like a giraffe or the \"Tickle me Lego\" toy, to fun things for adults like \"Machine with Minifig,\" there is something for everyone here.PROS: Plenty of project ideas for all levels of builders. Tips for building and programming. Ideas are open-ended to allow plenty of do-it-yourself experimentation.

Instead all it is is a few character sheets that have the picture from the main book of the different drawings of the different occupations and then a bunch of blank character sheets that you can download from the website for free. Also they are bound in the book so you can't take them out to photo copy them without tearing them out, or you just leave them in there but there is no customization at all. They're all the same. Really not worth buying. Just go to www.sengoku.com and download the character sheet for free and if you really want a picture in the blank space just photocopy it from the main book and paste it in.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: great material hampered by poor layout: Somewhere in this great history book there's a game. The authors have definitely done their homework in studying the culture of late 16th century Japan. They've also got a great filmography and bibliography at the back. As far as content is concerned, Sengoku sets the bar quite high for historical RPGs. The actual conversion of this historical information into a playable game is, however, a bit awkward. The book is also seriously hampered by the amateurish artwork and layout reminiscent of RPGs of 30 years ago. Still, I've worn the cover off my copy of the book so its obviously a worthwhile read.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.96)\n","\n","Review: Poor scholarship: This book is another example of \"hands-off\" scholarship in that it appears as if the editor never visited Montgomery but rather relied on secondary sources. Though there are numerous excerpts, the editor did not perform the necessary research which would have revealed (a) that the Boycott had its roots within the American labor movement and, more specfically, events which happened in Birmingham, Alabama, during the 1930s and (b) there probably still exists in the archives of the Montgomery Improvement Association or in at least one other place financial and other records not taken to the King Center which would have told an in-depth story using primary sources.

Most of the authors are pastors, and most of the chapters were originally published as articles in Leadership Journal. Various chapters discuss deciding when you should look for a new position, how to candidate (with very helpful questions to ask a search committee) and how to get off to a good start at your new church. The book is not so much about how to decide if its time to move, but rather when you've already decided, here is how you go about things. This is the most helpful book I have read on the subject.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Good To Go: This album is great man. No one can do it like Tego.

While the story held my interest and I had to see it through, I thought the writting was corny and the dialogue phony and juvenille.

They are a little apprehensive about their admission to Good Cheer Hospital, because there seems to be a rash of deaths of basically healthy people who have recently had surgery at the hospital. There is a rumor of a takeover of Good Cheer and there are plenty of quirky hospital employees as well as relatives of the deceased which gives Judith a long list of suspects. Her husband is working on a case dealing with homeless people and Judith suspects that there is a connection to the case she's working on. Undaunted by her surgery, Judith travels around the hospital in her wheel chair and, as usual, manages to solve the mystery before the police.

I kept hoping that Mary Daheim might get back into her groove. Not so. Somewhere along the line, the books have lost their charm. Renie has developed a severe overbite, with prominent front teeth, which is heavily focused on in the last few books. She has also gotten quite an attitude, making it difficult to get along with anyone. Added to that is Renie and Bill's ridiculous storyline of dressing their pet bunny, and in other books, being obsessed with their stuffed gorilla. They even go so far as to have Oscar the gorilla held hostage and have to negotiate for him! PLEASE!Gertrude's acided tongue has never entertained me, as realistically no one would put up with the verbal abuse heaped on throughout the years. Judith has turned into a doormat.On the plus side, I have read most of the Alpine Series, and so far they are delightful.

This is a great song with an awesome message. \"O O Baby\" is a really fun song with a good beat. My personal favorite on the album is \"Dear Friend,\" the final song on the CD, which Stacie wrote herself.

More like a poor quality sheet with a bit of down in between the layers. Made in China of only 74% down. To state that this comforter has a retail price of $160 is laughable! Really more of a throw than a comforter. At $50 it is grossly overpriced! Look elsewhere!\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Priced Right: We bought this to fill a duvet cover for summer. It's light weight, as we needed, and serves its purpose, considering the price and quality. Other similar light weight comforters in the marketplace cost 4+ times this one.

By this time the formula for future Anderson albums was in place: strong honky-tonk originals, a love song or two, a novelty song and just plain hardcore country. Two songs from this album went Top 10 Country (\"Chicken Truck\" and \"I'm Just An Old Chunk Of Coal\"). There are no liner notes here, but the sound is excellent. Anderson was one of a select few who brought traditional Country back to the charts. If you're a fan of real Country than this makes an excellent purchase.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: real country: I waited years for the vinyl to finally be released on cd.

I found this book in a near by bookstore convinced that my friend had herself gifted me with it. Because her passing was very sudden and shocking, the first part of the book did not call out to me but the parts on what happens afterward were immensely consoling. The quote by Karl Rahner alone is worth the price of the book and its found on p.129.A beautiful and compassionate gift to all believe.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Worst CD I bought in 5 years: I preordered this CD.

If the heart is true, the music is beautiful no matter whether the music is rock, rap... or in this case American Folk Music.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Ry's best work: This is an amazing disc. Much like his early work (Into the Purple Valley, Boomer's Story, etc.), this song cycle recreates the dust bowl era in modern sonic terms and musical language. It combines folk, jazz, blues, and protest songs into a charming, intelligent and entertaining mixture. If you are a fan of classic American music and clever storytelling, then this is the CD for you. It's the aural equivalent of some of Steinbeck's novels (`The Grapes of Wrath' and `Travels With Charlie' come to mind), crossed with `The Wind in the Willows'. That may sound like an odd mixture, but the results are wonderful.As in the best American folk music of the era Cooder is recreating, these songs are political motivated, socially aware and purposefully accessible to a wide group of people. His take on this form would do Woody Guthrie proud. This is the best musical purchase I've made in quite a while.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Ry Cooder: As an avid music fan with an abiding interest in the origins of popular music, I was again astounded by Ry Cooders ability to depict graphically the mood and sounds of the 30's. He has continually explored the origins of music from Africa to Cuba to Mexico to early America with consumate ease. My Name Is Buddy is only available on import in Australia and not for general release so I am proud to have my copy included in my collection. I trust that he, and others, continue to explore our musical roots and Ry Cooder remains as one of the Four or five artists who have had a profound effect on my musical knowledgePaul Thomas Australia\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Ry Cooder My name is Buddy: I do like the atmosphere on this CD.

The book and CD are just great. As a union member myself I was glad to have a musical record of some of the history of the movement, which has not been taught for years in the schools. Buddy and his friends journey across a dusty and violent America and try to find work. The pictures on the story book are priceless. The travelers have many adventures, and Buddy gets thrown in jail for being \"red,\" such a great joke on the union busters. Enjoy!

I was hoping I'd also fall in love with this skin treatment. I can't criticize anything specific, but I didn't love it. It has a nice texture, and a little goes a long way. It does make my skin feel soft, and the scent isn't too heavy. For a similar price,though, I think I prefer the Olay Pro-X or Regenerist line. Primary reason? I did have a few small break-outs after using Exuviance Restorative Complex for a couple of weeks. Did the Exuviance cause this? I'm not sure.

Terrible!: 1. Yes--> I am a Larry Carlton fan--> I've seen him numerous times over the years. As a baseline, my favorite albums are his earlier efforts etc... My favorite song (s) are strikes twice and mulberry street.2. Which makes this all the more frustrating--> how can such a great musician turn out such... completely boring music? I don't understand it and I guess I never will. The bottomline is--> if you tend to like neutral, tepid music (ie background music)--> this will be fine. Otherwise, skip this effort via Larry and pray that he comes back to life and puts out a good album.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Should put his talent to better use....: Larry Carlton is one fine guitarist, and fails to show off his talent in this latest release.

Mr. Carlton's latest effort is so lackluster and unimaginative that I frankly can't believe it! He has been a wonderful player over the years and my library is full of his work. This album appears to be dedicated to the proposition that a raised pulse is risky. It is almost a forced melancholy. Riffs are dull and the whole work seems stifled by a desire to be background music to a car ad or something. What a drag!!\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: What's with all the complaining?: Ok, after reading some of the reviews here, I have a few things to get off my chest. To you guys who panned this release because Larry isn't 'shredding' like he did 15 or 20 or 25 years ago - please note that Larry is growing up, you should take notes. If you want crunchy riffs and monstrous dexterity, go see Steve Vai or Joe Satriani. Larry's playing has matured into a warm sound that envelops like a 10 year old Cabernet or the arms of a familiar lover. Guys like Peter White could take a lesson here and there. And the nicest thing is the use of all REAL instruments, no annoying drum machines.With that said I have one beef about this release. Larry, and all other purveyors of 'smooth jazz', please take note: NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS. It reminds me too much of Muzak, ok? That's why you don't get 5 stars.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Larry's Careful New Album: I've been a fan of Larry Carlton for quite some time, and I still listen to the \"Sleepwalk\" album and find it to be just as vibrant now as when it came out. Larry has always been a tasteful player but with just a bit of edge to make things interesting. This new album sounds much too carefully drawn. The guitar is too far down in the mix and Larry seems to be playing session man on his own album. The 2 selections with vocals don't really add anything for anyone looking for Larry Carlton. I hope his next album finds him reaching a bit and taking some chances.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.85)\n","\n","Review: The obligatory contractual album: It is unbelievable that Larry Carlton could churn out such an album that is bereft of ideas and imagination.This album has plenty of sound but no music; sort of \"talk a lot but say nothing\". The performance is uninspired and lifeless and the music (I mean sound) is dreadfully tedious. The only good thing that I can say about this album is that it has a great album cover and excellent sound for testing hi-fi systems. But, I'm sure we Larry carlton fans do not buy his albums for such things. If there is one Larry Carlton album that you should avoid, this is the one. I can't think of any other album he has done which is as bad as this one. If you expect some magical moments like we always use to when we listen to some of his other albums, forget it.The next time I see Paul Brown's name on Larry's new album, I'll pass.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Chrysler/Blower: This product is exactly what is pictured and fit perfectly.

The director thinks that he is being morally ambiguous by presenting Bardem as a villain who rapes and plunders all form of human decency but actually he is being silly.

He is also very underated as an artist. Your Saving Grace is no exception. The title track is heavy with emotion and while not writen by Miller, shows off the talent of Tim Davis who was the backbone of the early stuff. The forcefull lovesong \"Little Girl\" and the civil rights motif \"Don't you let nobody\" are solid rock tracks with a hint of blues and a lot of attitude. \"Baby's House\" shows off the piano skills of Nicky Hopkins as well as Miller's strength as a vocalist. If you have Miller's box set you are missing out on the full version of this awesome song. \"Motherless Children\" has a blues twing and a solid emotional base that makes it a classic. While the album is short, it is a good buy. For the Miller enthusist it is well worth it.

The bilious opinions of Kerman, a conformist snob whose lack of depth, judgment or taste is meant to be obscured by relentless aggression and malevolence, are best ignored, or even used as a reverse guide. The opera lover does not need to care about what this intellectual dwarf has to say.

It is not a real \"happy\" book to read although it is very good.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Excellent content, Very easy reading, Historically correct!: I really enjoyed this book. The story was easy to follow, but very interesting. I enjoyed the detail put into the historical facts and character descriptions very much.

After a week of reading it I was sick of it. Plus it was way to slow.I wouldnt reccomend this book because in some spots its hard to tell whats happening.

The charatcters and the story were very well-written and woven into real history that I felt like i was relly there. The medical aspcet of it was interesting as well. I was also intrigued by all the body-snatchers and read more about them . The author presents a fair argument as to whether the bodies should have been left alone or used for mediacl science and I thought that her un-biased nature was commendable. This was a great book and I think this was definately the best yet.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: The Madness of Life: In this book Emily's world crumbles beneath her feet when her mother dies. She goes with her uncle instead of to her friend's (Annie) house like her mother and she had planned. After all of this she decides to stay in control of her life. By doing this she betrays her uncle's trust and loses her friend Annie. Annie, in Emily's eyes, has grown cold and heartless since they found evidence that her mother was involved with President Lincoln's assassnation. But since this is after the civil war they wouldn't hang a woman, would they? I thought this book was very discriptive and mysterious, so in my eyes it was a good book. I like it also because it was based on the truth and I like how the book ended, I guess you could say it was a different ending.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.73)\n","\n","Review: One of the Best: I am a big fan of Ann Rinaldi, and I definatly think this is one of her best. It is a great book to curl up with, and once you start reading, it's hard to stop. Is is about a young girl who is confused and frightened after the assination of Abraham Lincoln. The story is very intriguing and, as with most of her books, a small and not overdone love story is taking place between two of the characters. It is worth reading, whether you buy it or not.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Dark is right!: A fan of Rinaldi, I was looking forward to reading this book. The original plot was set up well, but as I read on it became more gruesome and frightening with every page. Its title says it all: the book is just plain dark.

Dead bodies, detailed accounts of hangings, nightmares, and assasinations are not what I look forward to in Ann Rinaldi's books.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Truly an \"Acquaintance With Darkness\": This a dark and mysterious book about an interesting and unthought of topic.

Plus, the players involved are quite good. This book could be useful for helping a beginner (to jazz) develop feel, at least in playing melodies.However, the flaws are pretty severe. Most songs have only 1 chorus of improvisation, some less. On \"Harlem Nocturne\" and \"Desafinado\", the solos are less than 12 bars TOTAL. Next, some arrangements are poor. \"A Night In Tunisia\" does not include the interlude before the break. \"Harlem Nocturne\" does not include the interval pattern at the end of the bridge.Again, this title might have a little value for a beginning jazz player to follow the melodies in an appropriate style. I can't recommend this to anyone else. There are better play-alongs out there.\"\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Poor!: I bought this to listen to a sax play better than me. No sax playing!

The characters, mostly Bess, were somewhat superficial and shallow, but this got better as the book progressed. As far as I am concerned, the only problem was the author's tendency to write page-long narratives of Bess's slightly maundering thoughts, which were fairly uninteresting and repetitive. But, as I said, it got much better by the end, and the final conclusion was very emotionally moving (I cried), even though anyone who's read Alfred Noyes' \"The Highwayman\" knew what would happen.The author is excellent at writing dark, emotional endings, and she used this ability to the full in this book. While there are the aforementioned problems, it's most definitely a page-turner, and if you like \"The Highwayman\" at all, you're pretty much guaranteed to like \"Watch by Moonlight\". It's not the sort of book you keep under your pillow and memorize, but it's a very good read even the second and third time.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A Necessity for any Lovebird Owner: Do not purchase a Lovebird until you read this book!

It reflects the genre of the Cowboy Bebop anime series, and all but one part of the first song (where we hear the opening theme song) are all original material.

The install was pretty simple, and then we downloaded the drivers. The PC recognized it fine, and recognized my ireless signal, but for some reason, the computer didn't recognize the wireless internet it was providing. We were unable to figure out why. About a week went by of fiddling with different things, like disabling the ethernet card, on the hypothesis that it was still somehow trying to draw internet from that, but even that didn't work.

Only one dongle works now and it's from Trendnet. So I decided to go with PCI cards for wireless internet. The first one I got was for my wife. It was a good deal until they doubled the price when I needed a few more. Trolling Amazon I went. After reading all of the reviews, I settled on this card. I purchased two and they work flawlessly. One is connected 24/7 to the Internet, my daughter can't miss a beat with Club Penguin, and the other runs an FTP server 24/7. I have had them for a while now, at least 6 months or so, and they work a lot better than most of the USB dongles I've had.

I recommend a more modern antenna!: okay, first of all it works, but the thing is that the antenna it comes with is sort of short, i mounted it to the top of my case, but it just looks sketchy.Secondly, the antenna broke on me today, and if you dont have the antenna connected to the pci screw in-no wireless... the screw in (with the little black tape that goes around the wire) is very sensitive almost to the point where its unfair. and like i said, no antenna no connection. my antenna broke off at the base and it makes the wireless pci care useless.And lastly, like i mentioned before the antenna looks like something out of the 80's with a little cliche tabletop design, but i just mounted it to the top of my case, and it still gets in the way when i take my case out to work on it.Im sure that this wireless card works fine connectivity and signal and all that, but once your antenna breaks its all over- NO MORE CONNECTION\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Not Worth It: This product constantly connects and disconnects every two seconds.

It is a replacement for the Buffalo wireless USB adapter the kids broke a couple of weeks ago. I wanted to get a replacement Buffalo product but found that a court injunction now bars Buffalo from selling many of their products in the US.I installed the Super G and it interfaced with the Buffalo router in 30 seconds.

Excellent reception - I'm using Linksys router with DD-WRT firmware and this card picks up consistant 5-bar signal. I've previously had Buffalo Airstation WLI2PCIG54S in the same machine and it only had around 2-bar of signal strength (same location.)2. Antena cable is about long enough to put it on top of a midsize tower.3. I run RaLink (for chipset RT61) on XP machine instead of the MSI supplied driver, also configured thru Window wireless option. So far, it's been stable, no drop signal.For price/performance ratio, I think this is a great choice.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.51)\n","\n","Review: Talk about plug and play!: I have windows Vista to start with.

The interface of the software is also good. However, the cable connecting the antenna and the card is too short, making it difficult and often impossible to find a good location for the antenna to have stable strong signal. This is especially true if the PC is located under a desk. The cable is too short for the antenna to reach the desk. My desk has metal legs, which may interfere with the wireless signals. I used this card for a year and was often irritated by the need for tweaking the position of antenna to get stable signal. Since PCs are not to be moved around, if possible, installing a network cable will be a far better solution than wireless. I finally bought an RJ45 crimper, connectors, and cat5e bulk cable (for about $80 total) to connect several rooms to my router.

On the other hand, his explanations on threads are one of the best - especially the diagrams. In short, I believe this book is not for the beginning Java programmer - more for someone who is between beginner and intermediate level.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.95)\n","\n","Review: Great book for existing programmers: This book is great for people (like me) who can already program, and just want to learn Java. I found it went at the right pace to get me the info I needed on Java. Most examples are small enough to understand easily, with much bigger ones inc. complete games & applications on the CD. Highly recommended if you want to learn Java, and already know C or Fortran or VB etc\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Excellent intro to Java and OOP for newbies.: I have read the book cover-to-cover. Peter is an excellent writer. He presented the details very clearly and kept me entertained. I found few errors which I can't say for many of the other technical books I've read. He has helped me get off on the right foot with Java and OOP programming. Readers will need other books to cover specific areas or APIs of Java in more detail.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Do not buy this book unless you know C++: I thought I'd be able to learn Java from this book, but after a few chapters I was totally frustrated by the way the author attempts to teach you Java in terms of C or C++, neither of which I know, neither of which are necessary to learn Java.I found the book condescending to non C and C++ programmers, and the order of subjects he chooses to teach Java is wierd.If you want to learn Java and don't know C or C++, do not look here, go to Dietel and Deitel's \"Java: How to Program\" instead.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Should be Java for C/C++ Programmers: The title of this book should have been, \"Java for C/C++ Programmers\". It is mostly a comparison of C/C++ programming to Java, heavy on the C part. But that is not the only problem. The author's writing style is more aimed at puffing up his own image than simple exposition of the subject. On page 91 he states, \"In 1993, I coined the term 'Bubbabyte' to describe 2^64 bytes. Just as 2^10 bytes is a kilobyte, [...] so 2^64 is a Bubbabyte.\" He should have coined the term 'BubbaBrain' to describe himself. A much better book is \"Core Java, Vol 1\", by Cay S. Horstmann, Gary Cornell.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Not a very thorough book: This book has some excellent reviews. As a student that has studied a few other languages, including OOP languages, I felt that this was the least helpful of all starting books that I've picked up. The code examples do not give you any inkling of how a real Java program may be used. The features of the Java language are introduced without explaining why they are needed and how they are actually used in real programs. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would like a clear example of the Java language.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Don't buy this book unless you already know JAVA: The reviews here are deceiving. Trust me. Unless you have already read another book on Java, you will have a hard time understanding it. The examples are fragmented and never complete. The author assumes that you know Java already and did not even bother to provide examples for many of the concepts. This may be a good book for intermediate level JAVA programmers, but it is definitely not for beginners. If I didn't know C++ at all, I would have thrown this book into the trash can the first day I read it. This ranks up there as one of the worst programming books I've ever read, a total waste of my hard-earned money.

I have more than three years of programming experience in procedural languages like COBOL. I am familiar with C. I am familiar with basic OO concepts. I thought I was an intelligent and competent programmer. This book did its best to destroy my confidence.To be frank: this is the worst programming book I have ever come across. It gives you half baked ideas, and keeps them that way. Before a concept is fully grasped, the author goes on to say something else in an equally vague manner. If you can find even one single concept clearly explained in this book, you are lucky.Bottomline: This book is great for you if your ambition is to drop a few heavy-sounding technical terms in a gathering of programmers who are not so comfortable with Java. If your ambition is to learn and master a new language from scratch, look elsewhere.P.S. The sale of this book is a classic example of what media hype can do.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Not bad, but not for newbies: This book is great for those with previous OO experience (or at least a strong knowledge of C programming), but for those who are new to programming, I would recommend trying The Java Tutorial by Campione, et al.

It as easy to read statements like \"you invoke the method call implicitly by instantiating the object with a reference.\" Mr. Van der Linden is evidently a great programmer, but not a very good teacher.

Its a Pop-up kind of thing (the moving parts of pop-ups, not the actual 3D stuff) all made of thick card board so its pretty indestructable. That is, except for the cover. I'm not sure what they were thinking. Its a single piece of cardboard, flimsier than cereal box cardboard. I'm not sure why they did that, especially since the reverse of the cover is the first page of the book. The rest of the pages (and back cover) are all thicker than even the sturdiest boardbook.

Before I brought her home I went to the local Petco the pick up some puppy pads, which are a foreign idea to me, having housetrained previous dogs on newspapers when I was growing up. However, I thought I would give them a shot. Of course there were about 5 or 6 brands to choose from, but I liked the idea that in theory these are extra special because of the \"just-cut grass\" smell they add. Well, I brought them home with low expectations, and I am not saying that she doesn't still have accidents, but I am amazed at how well she is responding to them! Maybe 75% of the time she seeks out the puppy pad on her own accord and uses it. I am about to run out; so I might buy regular pads and see if there is a difference. Overall, I would say they are worth a try, especially since they are only slightly more expensive. Good luck!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.94)\n","\n","Review: Costly but good: This trainning pad is the most absorbant I've ever seen. It also attracts your pooch and can be soiled via urine a couple of times before being discarded. You never seem to smell urine and never have to worry about leakage however it is very costly. I have found pads that are much cheaper with slightly less of a quality.

You will have to stick out the first 10 - 20 minutes as this entertainer has a slow start, but ultimately it's worth it.We were very disappointed in the quality of the DVD as well as the video. It was comparable to an \"OK\" video tape. The sound quality is fine, but the \"extra\" information isn't.

Christian music is different from secular music, and the difference is that Christian musicians are there to praise God, instead of praising themselves for their talent, and to guide listeners' heart and mind to God through music. And Jennifer is one of the most successful singers to achieve that challenging task. Her music is not an entertainment or show; even in her concerts, one can see and feel that she is sharing her own experience with God with her audience, and that she truly loves her Lord.Her voice is extraordinarily pleasant and expressive, mature at the same time full of life.

Its lesser popularity is most likely due to the subject matter, which focuses upon sin, and the fact that it doesn't have the \"happy ending\" most people seem to require. However, it is a terrific work, definitely the equal of Pilgrim's Progress or Grace Abounding. Bunyan, as usual, finds new meaning in many verses of scripture that one might otherwise overlook.

If the character is reading something, you aren't. Every single time the author says that someone is reading something, it immediately cuts ahead to when they put the document away.

It's more or less readable, but the frequency of errors is just inexcusable... even if it is less than a dollar. There are random breaks in mid-paragraph and mid-sentence (random meaning there is no apparent reason for it; they actually show up pretty consistently), missing words at the start of chapters or paragraphs, and several typos (typos that don't exist in the print version I also bought).The story itself is an easy 5 stars.

Of course, older translations may be your thing (they're certainly mine much of the time) but you should know that this edition isn't all it seems.

Through carefully observing under the x30 jewelers scope, the refractive index of the center stone seems to be very low, about 1.6, which is very close to glass but not CZ. Typically, a CZ has a refractive index around 2.15. And diamond is 2.4.

Joanne Dru is far superior in a similar type of role in the follow-up \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.\" The screenplay to \"Fort Apache\" could have been tightened up dropping about 10 minutes and giving it a more streamlined result. \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" is a superior film because of a better handled script. Having said that, \"Fort Apache\" is still very entertaining. Its strength is in its opposing characters played by Henry Fonda and John Wayne. It's easy to focus on Fonda's martinet of a commander, but Wayne is excellent in his somewhat secondary role. He's almost an observer on equal footing with the supporting players and that generosity pays off with a very likeable, heroic character. I don't like \"Fort Apache\" enough to add it to my collection, as I have \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,\" but it's still a film to watch and enjoy.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: One of the best: One of my favorite movies!

But more importantly, it wasn't even fun.Okay, maybe it was fun for about an hour as I learned my way around the game. But that was mostly anticipation. I then realized that I'd seen all there was to see. Don't waste your time. This game is simplistic and has no depth whatsoever. SimCity is still the best real estate game around, even if it is only in a roundabout sort of way. If you want a good, educational business game, try Capitalism 2.

I do think that if your child wants to color the pictures in, you'll want the bigger stampers. But this set is so cute, easy to store, and the 4-color stamp pad is nice.

I especially liked the comparison of today's railroad operations with how the railroad routes were constructed. For example, the engineering and hard work it was to build the roadbeds for the trains over mountain passes even before many of the roads were built. Some of the routes followed rivers or covered wagon trails. This video series sure beats a lot of the programming coming to my TV.

Screaming, jumping around, arms flailing, and extremely dumb dialog (you can see just about everyone he interviews/works with cringes at the things he says). On top of that, the rapid jump cutting is enough to make you want to hurl. No joke! Most of the scenes shot of Matt's dialog is with the camera right on the ground pointing up towards him while he's shouting at the camera flailing his arms around.This could have been an excellent series, but it is ruined and unwatchable by the script and host.

One must have some awareness of the Genesis text and scholarship of Gerhard von Rad and his American disciples, of whom Davie Napier is one; but Napier goes beyond von Rad in his interpretive skills and possesses unique insights.

She varies strophes imaginatively, her diction is clear, and her voice is opulent...I recommend this release to all singers looking for neglected gems.\"2. Review by &#65279;John Warrack, Gramophone, February 1997\"With one of Goethe's most famous lyrics, Mignon's \"Kennst du das Land\", genius was not burning at its brightest with eitherBeethoven, Schubert or Schumann, and though the dramatic power of Wolf's great song was hardly at Spohr's command, he did make a fine, strong, perceptive setting that deserves much wider currency. Marjorie Patterson and Daniel Sarge perform it with the conviction it deserves; they are an excellent Lieder duo, with the intelligence to sense the expressive weightof each song.\"\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Straight to the point: \"Seduce Me\" is primarily a book about sexuality between couples. Many couples recall when they were first dating and it seemed that they were constantly touching each other. At time wears on that touching becomes less and less and sexual activity also declines. Author Darcy Cole discusses physiological and psychological factors in this change and how to get back the sexual fire. She notes that it takes very little to get men in the mood for sexual relations but men don't generally understand what is required to get a woman in the mood. This book details the various factors involved and how they work together to get a woman interested in sex. \"Seduce Me\" is very detailed in its descriptions and provides a wealth of information for those who want to understand the process of female seduction. While many parents would have a big problem with this book being included in a high school library, it is a very appropriate book for those wanting to increase their partner's sexual desire.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Disappointed: I was disappointed after reading this book. It was written for men who want to get their partners more interested in sex. It does nothing for the woman who wishes to get her man more interested.

Even though it was released in 1982, it still feels as fresh as tomorrow's flavor du jour.

I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma. Emma is supposed to be 21 and beautiful, not 31 and weird looking. I know that that sounds a bit shallow, but movies are a visual medium, and poor Godwin has a long, scrawny chicken neck and is slightly pop-eyed.

The style and differences between its production and what a modern day version would be like is striking. Almost entirely shot in a studio with very little accompanying music make this version almost a stage adaptation. Emma's father is quite brilliantly portrayed and is very amusing. The first episode is rather dull if truth be told but the remaining five episodes more than make up for this opening.

At this point, I should have stopped the movie, which went downhill until the end, which was the most disturbing scene.

And yet, Barbieri's score and Storaro's cinematography are still a delight to both ear and eye (although you can see the camera's reflection on a window pane at the last scene!).Regarding sex, there's not much to be said. In fact, there was a lot said and little to be seen. Brando gives \"the performance of a lifetime\", which in his case, after seeing \"Superman\", is probably true. Maria Schneider is so, so; Jean Pierre Laúd is execrable and Mássimo Girotti all but steals the show as Brando's funny-you-should-ask rival.

On how many different occasions in one film do we need to hear about pigs? I have never understood why this movie is lauded so much, so I decided to give it another chance. The dialogue is simply absurd. Who talks like this? The relationship between Brando and the young French girl is very S&M;, but in my opinion, these themes were explored better and more attractively in \"9 1/2 Weeks\". If you're looking for nudity and graphic sex, you won't find that here either. The sex scenes are few and far between, and when they do occur your reaction will most likely be \"OH!

Virtually every aspect of the film is risible. In fact, you can probably enjoy it purely for its innumerable unintentioned laughs. Marlon Brando gives what can only be described as one of the messiest and shameful performances that any formerly great actor could conceive (worse even than Vito Corleone or Kurtz).

It still seems like an indulgent, boring mess. Yes, Brando can act.Yes, Maria Schneider has a fantastic 20-year old body. What does it all add up to? Nothing! A 2 hour waste of time. A movie with a totally emoty story and emotional core. I like a lot of stufffrom the late '60s and early '70s, but if sitting through tedium like this in the name of art was indicative of the era - thankGod we've moved on.

Is it about love? Is it about irony? Is it about lust? Is it about loss? What is it all about? That, in my view, is the beautey of this film: Nobody is for sure, yet most everyone knows that it's a classic.Brando gives the performance of a lifetime. For those who want to know what real acting is, I recommend they see the scene with Brando and his dead wife's body. It's majestic, to say the least.In this film, Brando lets himself go and seems to let the viewer inside his mind - if not soul.The musical score is passionate, lustful, erotic and majestic all at once. It's wonderful.Bertulluci was creating a sure winner here when he was directing. He shows what a talented director he truly is.I advise anyone to see this film 3 or 4 times. With each viewing, the viewer will get more of an insight into the mind of one terribly lonely man.

Brando gives on of his best performances (see also Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, The Godfather and Apocalypse Now). Without Brando this film would have been utterly boring. It's the kind of film you have to watch a few times in order to make sense of everything. The film just starts and you have to put the pieces together--and character motivation is rather difficult to figure out. In fact, although this film is a good film, it's confusing as to why the characters do what they do. If you love Brando and Bertolucci, I'd recommend seeing this film. If you want to learn technique and style of acting--this is a very good film. I don't think we'll see another actor like Brando who gives memorable performances such as he does in this film.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.98)\n","\n","Review: worth seeing: While this is not exactly the great movie it's reputation suggests, it comes close. It is a must-see for Brando fans, in particular. It is hard to seperate his performance from the movie itself - he is the movie; the director intended it to be that way. Almost all the details of Brando's character were modeled after him, which makes it all the more facinating. Gato Barbieri's music is also great, making the movie even more effective.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A movie that redefines tedium: Feeble, inarticulate and struggling to be deep without knowing what it wants to be deep about.

I've seen many films that could fit this description such as \"Happiness\" by Todd Solondz and \"Romance\" by Catherine Breillat, but unlike those films, I failed to see a point in this one.The sex scenes were extremely grotesque in their graphic and perverse nature, especially the scene involving sodomy.I can't say I would reccommend this film to anyone. The reason that it gets 2 stars out of 5 is because I think Marlon Brando was very convincing and entertaining, I just failed to see the point in this film as a whole and therefore I cannot give it a good rating.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: nothing of value: It will make me unpopular to say this, as if I am not already wildly unpopular, but this was a terrible and totally overrated movie. In light of Marlon Brando's semi-recent death I thought it high time to see some of his best known works. Cited as a classic in many cases, at least for being raunchier than anything else at the time of its release, this film was flat, left me dazed, it was useless. I hated it. It was strange, mumbling, sleazy. The acting-particularly from Maria Schneider-if you could call it acting, anyway-was mediocre at best. Where's the story? This just strikes me as a film made at the time to push the envelope of what was considered \"art\" and \"decent\". To me, it was just a monumental waste of time, like roughly half of Bernardo Bertolucci's work.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Can't be that great.: I saw this film at a special screening in the late 1970's at an art house cinema in Minneapolis.

Its not like me to get amneisia about a film, especially if it is trully a great work of art.

Its amazing how many people say how great this film is and Brando, but to me he was just a mumbling psycho that terrized a young woman.

If you are watching it to see the controversial steamy sex scenes, you'll be disappointed. There is nothing erotic here. It's a film devoid of emotion or excitement. It's mind-numbing and boring. It may have been praised at the time it was first released, but it has not aged well. Surprising that it was ever determined to be a film with any value even when first released. Pointless film with characters that don't seem to have any direction in their lives and don't seem to care about anything important. The viewer doesn't care either.

Everything he said and did in this movie (especially to the unprincipled French tramp) was too savage, sick and pathetic for words and his fate at the end was much-deserved but didn't come soon enough.

Its clear to me that every single reviewer who gave a good review must've been paid off handsomely. To me, words like \"vacant\", \"nihilistic\", \"empty\", instantly and effortlessly leap to mind.

I strongly recommend this edition for anyone who is not already familiar with Shakespeare's plays.I recently bought a Kindle edition of three tragedies. The type face is very good but there are no notes or essays whatsoever. I would not recommend any of the Kindle editions that I have seen for anyone who is not already fully conversant with Shakespeare's language.

I was very suprised when I first listened to this album. To find Sufist teachings hidden in a funk/house album, was really a new thing. Mercan Dede, did not only use the background and rythm from Sufi Music but also the teachings. Especially the song \"Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi\", named after the famous Persian Sufi, is a 5 Star song of the album. Without using words Mercan Dede manages to show that life is a circle. \"Walking on the Red Sea\", is a good example of how Mercan Dede is succesful in mixing Sufi Rythm with other backgrounds. In my opinion these points helps this album become universal and reach audiences far beyond any other etnic funk album would do.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Exciting Action and Adventure: I came upon this book by chance, and was overwhelmingly surprised.

But I do actually think Dawn on a Distant Shore is better written. There's so much action, every time you think a matter is resolved, another one pops up right on its heels.

From the beginning to the end, the pace is breathless, wild and hectic. This is a chase novel, through and through. Ms. Donati keeps the emotions running high as we travel from New York to Canada to Scotland and the tension doesn't let up for a minute. She is able to convey the emotions and nuances of family ties and keep us interested in her characters. She comes up with a spectacular new villain and some protagonists that end up very sympathetically. While I admit I missed Hidden Wolf and the characters there, Ms. Donati has left many dangling threads that are sure to be dealt with in her third novel in the series and we'll see all these wonderful and not so wonderful people again. I really liked this book. I read it one sitting...long into the night!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Dawn on a Distant Shore: I found \"Dawn on a Distant Shore\" to be colorful and also a look into how life was in the late 1700's in America and Ireland.

Start reading yours and you'll see what I mean.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Lovely Romance: The story was a bit on the long side, but was entertaining enough that I was able to finish in only three days.

I still have not found anyone who writes like Gabaldon. I'll make this short and sweet in that I do not think that Donati has developed her characters as well as she could. I wanted the story to be wrapped more around Elizabeth and Nathaniel, but instead, much of the story came from Hannah's point of view. I realize this is probably due to the fact that Hannah's character is being built for an upcoming book, but I was not interested. Elizabeth's character was developed well, but I felt in both Into the Wilderness and Dawn on a Distant Shore, that Nathaniel did not have as strong of a character and hero image as I would have liked. I just did not feel the passion between these two as I had hoped. Even the ending was very weak to me.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.70)\n","\n","Review: A Strong 4.5 Stars: This is a great sequel to Into The Wilderness, just slightly weaker.

I highly recommend this book.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Dawn on a Distant Shore: I was hoping that this would be a great sequel, but was very disappointed. The characters, except for Hanna did not develop at all.

That said I await the next book because I trust Ms. Donati will continue the story without destroying the characters.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.94)\n","\n","Review: I'm glad I didn't spend the money on it.: I got it at the library and boy am I glad I didn't waste my money by buying it, which I might have done based on Donati's first novel. I am sooo disappointed! This was a snoozorama to say the least. I guess I can only hope for improvement in the 3rd novel. This novel was just sooooooo slow and boring, Daniel and \"Boots\" had no chemistry which was very disappointing\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: It's a good thing that I read Into the Wilderness first or I never would have bothered to read another one of her books.

This time around, the characters bordered on boring, the plot lines forgetable and Donati's sweeping prose sadly absent. I thought this was an overall tough read. Hopefully the next one will be more of a page turner like the first one was.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: The story falls over: The story falls over before it ever gets started. It doesn't convince me that the only course of action possible is for Nathaniel to try to rescue his father, or that any mother with the sense God gave a goose would take newborn babies on such a dangerous trip. I know Sacajawea went on a much harder trip while pregnant, but this book needed to convince me, and it didn't.The adventures and dangers are thrown at us too fasst and furiously. We are not given much chance to enjoy the peaceful spots or anticipate or fear the next obstacle. It's boring the way any laundry list of problems is boring if a reader don't care whether or not the characters get through it. Or if they don't really believe the plot in the first place.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Yawn.: I loved Into the Wilderness! This cannot be the same author. It was boring. The characters were dull and the whole book dragged.

This story contained little action and far too much gossip. These wonderful outdoorsmen (and women) were confined to rocking in ships for 300 pages! I was as homesick for the mountains as Hannah was. I love Ms. Donati's characters but I was as uncomfortable as they were in their oversea adventure. I do hope she brings them home for the next installment. If I hadn't read the first book I would never have finished this one - the plot was too much of a stretch - but the Bonners are terrific and I had to know what happened to them.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.79)\n","\n","Review: Not as good as her other books: I enjoyed the rest of the series, but I found this book boring compared to the rest.

Much to my dismay, this book did not live up to my expectations. Is it a coincidence that Gabaldon's Voyager and this book, both set mainly upon the high seas, were my least favorite out of each author's series? Hmmm. The only thing that kept me going was the promise of the third book Lake in The Clouds. The book is worth reading, don't get me wrong. Especially for those who continue on with a series. The Scotland thing seemed unnecessary to me. I would have been happier if they'd stayed in North America. Oh well. Artistic license.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.97)\n","\n","Review: An excellent read!: For all those Diana Gabaldon fans, Sara Donati does not disappoint. Well written and researched, Donati's books are a must read. Her characters are multi-layered and three dimentional, and the plot intricate and captivating, to say nothing of educational. Anyone reading these books will not be disappointed, but especially those with high standards. Into the Wilderness, and Dawn on a Distant Shore kept me burning the midnight oil many a night. I highly reccommend this series, for which there is a third soon to be published. If you want depth, and hate \"fluff\", then these books are for you. Thankyou Ms Donati for giving me something worth reading.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Very disappointing!!!: I was so thrilled with vol. 1 \"Into the Wilderness\" that I ordered the second volume from the library before investing money into a hardcover version.

The story line at the castle was a pick-me-up, but you had to read several hundred pages before you got there. I was extemely disappointed in this book and the only reason I finished it was because I didn't want to see the money I spent on the book wasted.

Plenty of room for air mat and family of 4.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.89)\n","\n","Review: Large: What strikes me the most is how roomy this tent is, though it's not possible to stand up straight. It works well for 4 people, though 6 might be too much. I like having a little wiggle rom for getting dressed without stepping on someone.It appears to be waterproof, though I haven't been in a big rainstorm yet, just very wet fog. Zippers work well and I like the color of the tent. The view from the inside \"windows\" is great and makes it airy if needed.The reason why I give it an average+ rating is that it's impossible to set up by myself.

I am 6'5'' and could stand up comfortably in the center of this tent.It rained 2 of the 3 nights we were out there, and one night it POURED. Despite the usual loudness of the rain on the fly, this was a pleasant experience. No rain got into the tent, and thanks to the ceiling vents and well designed fly, we stayed cool and happy the entire night.Easy to set up, easy to take down. Easy to shake off after a rainfall to pack up immediately.1 adult and 4 kids was no problem, everyone had PLENTY of personal space. I imagine 4 adults fit in quite comfortably.Eureka hasn't let me down, and if you are in the market for a HUGE tent, this is the one to get.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Good deal: Not official NFL product but saved money and quality was good enough.

I purchased because I wanted that bottle that was pictured that would stand upright and not leak all over. Instead, I got a tiny tube with significantly less threadlocker than was anticipated. Toolfetch doesn't charge much for the tube, but quite a bit (almost 3x) for shipping, so you won't return it if, like me, you weren't paying close enough attention and relied on their picture to be an accurate representation of what they were shipping. Based on the fact you can't blow the picture up enough to read the printing on the bottle to confirm its volume, the marked-up then marked-down pricing and the disproportionate shipping charge, I can only conclude that this was intentional on the part of toolfetch.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: In a cave, but not The Cave: At first look, this movie would seem like a rip off of The Cave, and does have a similar concept, but much better done. It's not often that a movie grabs your attention within the first 5 minutes, but this one does and keeps it until the end. Lots of things popping out should keep you guessing. It's a nice addition to the horror genre and dances circles around it's U.S. counterpart.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: If only real women were like this . . .: _The Descent_ is a movie featuring some very tough girls. Athletic, young, strong, mentally tough, and brave. When the going gets tough they meet the challenge and there is very little whining. Even when it comes time to die they face it bravely. In today's largely sedentary society where people are more concerned about political correctness than survival you aren't likely to meet many women (or men!) like this.

The all female cast does a phenomenal job of keeping the audiences attention (and no there is no nudity). Shows what a talented director and cast can do with little money and a good story.

Every so often a film comes along that accomplishes this and 'The Descent' is a prime example. The film is a departure from the clutter of junk horror films that have been released over the past few years by not merely infiltrating you with just startle scenes. The sheer fear factor of being trapped hundreds of feet below ground with the prospect of death at every turn is simply the cornerstone of the aural terror you feel throughout most of the film.The Blu-ray presentation is immaculate from the reference quality video to the PCM 6.1 lossless audio track that is amazingly immersive. A must see for any horror fan and a 'high recommend' for anyone!\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A Claustrophobic Mess: Bland characters, murky filming and gratuitous gore make for a horror movie mess in The Descent.

I even had low expectations going into this. A horror movie about monsters in a cave. Geez, there's an original idea. Anyways, maybe it's because it was all about women only that women reviewers are giving it such high remarks. I don't know. Maybe the ten minutes of actual action at the end made people forget about the 90 minutes of BORE you had to sit through until that point. This movie was stupid and boring. Maybe I was not as impressed because I watched this movie the same day I watched SAW IV.

The first half of the movie is scarier than the rest, because it involves a group of six women exploring a dangerous underground cave. Being extremely claustrophobic, that alone was scary enough for me! However, then the women start being hunted by evil Gollum-like creatures who live deep within the cave, and the film takes a turn for the worse. If you're a fan of horror films, you'll probably enjoy \"The Descent\" because it's gruesome and relatively scary, unlike most of the ridiculous films that currently pepper this film genre.

The film looks ugly and boring on Blu-ray with over staurated colors and high contrast levels. Lionsgate has packed the disc full of impressive special features which further enhance the ugly and boring nature of the film. You can watch the ugly and boring director in \"behind the scenes\" footage in a PIP documentary while watching the film. Loads of extra and extended scenes, interviews etc. do nothing to alleviate all the ugly boredom this film invokes.

It's basically a chick flick with mutants in it for the last 25 minutes or so. A Horror movie? Suspense? Right. I guess this is the new style of \"horror\" I'll stick with Halloween, The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Basically, 6 young women go to the mountains and romp around together trying to help their one friend through the loss of her family, this consists of the first 50 some minutes of the movie. THEN they FINALLY go to this cave and after another 15 minutes you see what's chasing them and wanting to kill them.. The mutants are actually pretty neat but you don't see much of them as this is more like \"Sweet Home Alabama meets The Gargoyles\".

Dog Soldiers was OK, but Descent is by far and away superior in every way.Like the lackluster American version called - THE CAVE - the British version - The Descent - is written bettter, with less special effects. That should teach and show directors out there that special effects ain't everything. A solid plot is first. Good actors is 2nd. Special effects comes 3rd. Not the other way around.Although both movies only touch very little on the hugely sucessful, bestseller novel, The Descent, by Jeff Long, both movies could have greatly benefited if they could have done the movies much more closely to the novel.

Many other flaws and mistakes led to their demise leaving me unsympathetic to their plight. In addition the ending was confusing. Interesting to watch regardless.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!: I thought this movie was one of those horror movies that took forever to get to the point!!!It reminded me of Wolf Creek which I barely watched.

I wish the story line could have figured out a different way to find these creatures instead of showing flashbacks of people cheating with other women's husbands before he died and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah.

It's just a bunch of horrifying images with little to no character developement. Was I supposed to care about these women or just watch them all die and hope I find the death scenes enjoyable? And exactly how many centuries would it take for humans to become bat like is beyond me, but I don't think it would have happened just yet. And how strong are these things? They can take down large game and wolves but a 110 pound woman can take out 4 of them at the same time? Whatever. The deleted scenes are horrible and deserved to be deleted, maybe they should have deleted the whole movie. I gave it 2 stars just because the movie was somewhat watchable until the end. What the hell was that anyway? If it would have ended with the dream getaway I would have said it was a bad movie, but the actual ending made me dislike it even more.

And this comes from a person who watches almost nothing but horror every day. Never has a movie been so bleak since \"John Carpenter's The Thing\". Neil Marshall first made his mark on \"Dog Soldiers\", another excellent film, and the direction here was even more fantastic. The all-female cast was perfect, just spot-on, and the creatures both looked and acted like no others I have ever seen. The gore was immense, absolutely amazing, you will do yourself a favor by picking up the unrated version of the film. This movie is beyond your typical hack n' slash horror film, the characters are so greatly fleshed out you really get a chance to know and become attached to them. None of the women are just disposable gore fodder. Bloody, disgusting, frightening, claustrophobic, amazing.

It was a predictable storyline about a bunch of young women who go into a cave, and then they predictably get stuck and have to search for another way out.Once they're stuck in the cave, you can probably guess what happens next. Odd creatures come out (who apparently can't see, and have to rely on their hearing) and attack the women, in different ways. They weren't as scary as people made them out to be. Just typical-looking monsters.A big problem I had with the Descent was that the picture was incredibly dark, because the majority of the movie takes place in a cave, so darkness is mostly all around them, except for the flashlights and whatnot. A very dark film.There were a couple moments that made me jump, such as that scene in the beginning of the film when the woman jumped out of bed and walked to the window. Other than that, the movie was just a typical horror and bloodfest. It would be a good idea to look elsewhere.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: one star and one jump: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I jumped once, but that doesn't make a scary movie. The first half of the film, nothing happens.. they all meet up, try to appeal to the male crowd by being all female, and you have all the typical characters. The know-it-all, the one with a bad past, the cocky one, etc. The reason this is not \"intense\" is that you see the creatures completely, they look like naked people that are all greasy (it's not a sexy as I just put it). and even the ending... spoiler... you don't know if she sees her friend who either somehow, impossibly made it out, or she is seeing it in her head, like she was doing throughout the movie.

You will find yourself just as scared as the victims in this movie. You will be clenching onto the nearest item in anticipation for what is going to happen next. Because, trust me, you really have no idea what will happen next.I found myself practically leaping out of my seat in terror. And, trust me everyone, that RARELY happens. I go through most movies with a whatever attitude and don't show any fear. I make it through movies like The Exorcist without breaking a sweat.

When they ultimately get to the depths of the cave things just become dark and confusing. By the end of the film I didn't know who was dead or dying and really didn't care.This is a well made film, but it could have been great if they had taken a cue from 'Deliverance' and reduced the amount of characters to four and gotten a well known actress or two.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Looks good on blu-ray: Hmmmmmm, a few thoughts come to mind, gruesome,goulish,bloody.

Why those opening weekend box office returns of course!Instead, \"The Descent\" takes the road less traveled, no pun intended. The cast are relative unknowns (at least to me, sorry if any of these women are household names in another country, shame on my ignorant behind) and they are all exceptional. These characters balance gritty and vulnerable so well. Altruistic and nurturing one minute, egomaniacal and totally aloof the next.The film exploits a common phobia; being trapped, enclosed places, etc., by showing us the most extreme and terrifying scenario.

Gore shoots from the creatures and women as if propelled from a pressure washer, the creatures somehow rip several of the women to shreds without their teeth coming into contact with flesh, their movements look ridiculous as they are not actually moving more quickly but the film rate is, the \"monsters\" are on camera far too much and end up looking silly rather than scary, a woman accidentally kills a companion in the heat of battle and is judged, crippled and left for dead by another of the group, a dream/gotcha ending, and a nonexistent plot.I am a fan or horror movies, but this one is just not good. It starts off with a compelling story and then ends up being a slasher flick with characters so annoying, protagonist included, that you cannot wait for them to die.

I'm sorry, but with the wound that she had, I would have expected her to be dead.

The acting, atmosphere and gore were all top notch for this genre. Some people I went with didn't even know it was a creature film. They thought one of the girls was going to go psycho in the cave and start killing them all off. Boy were they surprised. I caught the UK ending on another website, and while I prefer that one by far, the U.S. closer wasn't too shabby either. The only thing I didn't really care for were the creatures. They were a little scary at first, but once they started showing swarms of them, they lost that creepy factor. The build up to actually seeing them was so good. I enjoyed the cave diving and crawling parts as much as the creature fest to come. Plus they weren't intimidating and hard to kill like the creature in another film similar to the feel of this one, called Alien.

I had never seen these actresses, who here play members of a hiking group embarking on a misadventure in an unexplored cave, but I was duly impressed. Natalie Jackson Mendoza (Juno) is beautiful almost to a fault and very gifted. It would be nice to see her in prominent roles in the future.The psychological aspect of the horror in this movie keeps building tension and is intelligently handled, where a lot of things are hinted at but not spelled out for the audience, and the caves and the things that happen inside them are unexpected and disturbing.No doubt about it, this movie does justice to its genre and I daresay that even the seasoned horror fan will be affected by it in some way. It is not a movie that leaves you indifferent to the fate of the characters, and the ending is unapologetic and unrelenting (European version).\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Dinosaurs are back and you're lunch!: Do you hear that buzz?

After listening to this anemic attempt at capturing the power of a acclaimed musical portrait by using synthesized instruments, one is left to wonder why a recording company hasn't recorded this piece using a large orchestra. It just begs for the real thing. At least with a large orchestra there might be more justification to charge $23 for just 33 minutes of music. I would strongly urge classical music lovers to approach with caution if they are thinking of buying any of the other selections in this classical music series played by Alexander Jero. Too bad Amazon doesn't offer a money-back guarantee on opened CDs. As for the sound, it is enveloping, if you like to be surrounded by harsh virtual instrumentation.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.81)\n","\n","Review: beware: The product does give the surround sound experience, which sounded okay in my cars audio system.

That was the scariest thing about this movie. I was probably about 8 or 9 at the time. I remember watching \"The Incredible Hulk\" on a Friday night and the commercials came on. This face appeared on the screen and I thought it might be the show, but it wasn't. They kept zooming in on him and I got scared. From then on, every time I saw the ad, I would switch the channel or cover my eyes. And over the years, whenever I've seen the ad, I've nearly jumped out of my skin. Yeah, Fats was SCARY!\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.98)\n","\n","Review: More Ham-O-Rama Theatrics From Sir Anthony: Whenever anyone I know blathers on about how great an actor Sir Anthony Hopkins is, I tell them to stick this in the VCR. It's a horror movie, alright: a horror to sit through. lt's Battle of the Uncured Hams as Sir Anthony, Ann-Margret and Burgess Meredith act up a storm on a script that should have never seen the light of day. Fats the Dummy is unquestionably the best actor in this movie but regrettably has to share scenes with the aforementioned actors; if only Fats had been able to break away from Sir Anthony's arm earlier in the movie and massacred the entire cast, I'd be writing a five-star rating instead of this. If you need convincing that Hopkins' success in \"Silence of the Lambs\" was just a fluke and that he is indeed just another tough slice of fatty Welsh ham, watch a double feature of this and \"Legends of the Fall\"; Hopkins is like some Monty Python grotesque played for pathos instead of comedy.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Take The Knife Up The Hill And Rent This Movie!: forget the fact that the viewer has no clue HOW hopkins' Corky got involved with the dummy, or HOW he even got famous at all. the big deal here is Hopkin's performance. reminicent of early Peter Lorre, hopkin's descent into dementia is mesmerizing, and, as \"Fats\", his high pitched Brooklynese ventriloquism is absolutely chilling.Whenever other characters (i.e. Ann Margaret and Burgess Meredith) invade the screen, the movie becomes pathetic. When Hopkins and Fats the dummy are alone together, it is one of the finest spectacles ever commited to film by a single actor.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: MAGIC ADS WERE SCARY!: Though the movie was frightening enough, it wasn't what I saw one night alone in a Poconos hotel room while my parents were out dining and dancing. What I witnessed was the thing that STILL freaks me out when I think about it. The Magic commercial. All it was was Fats the dummy reciting a demonic poem. I can still say the poem to this day. I was so scared, I could not leave the bed until my parents arrived back, hours later.I must be honest, ventriloquist dummies still scare me to death. They should totally release the commerical to video or DVD. From what I see, enough people of my age were freaked out about it and would probably LOVE to see it again.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Deliciously disturbing ....Highly Underestimated: FINALLY it comes out on dvd. This film is absolutely brilliant. Psychologically scarred me as a kid. I've never been able to think of ventriloquists or their wooden counterparts in quite the same way since.

Thank you, Dark Sky , for making that possible.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Magic: If you like Anthony Hopkins, this is one of his best. It is a bit \"off\" but it keeps you watching. A very different movie. Saw this years ago and remembered it. It never comes on cable.

The BluRay transfer was done very nicely and the extras were pretty good but could have been better.I really enjoyed the Dennis Alwood interview, Fats and Friends. I do wish there were new interviews with Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret though. There is an old, archival Anthony Hopkins interview which leaves much to be desired. Though it's better than nothing.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A ventriloquists nightmare: Magic is a timeless suspense film starring Anthony Hopkinks, Ann Margret, and the always entertaining Burgess Meredith(better known as Mic from Rocky.) The story follows an up and coming ventriloquist \"Corky\" and his dummy \"fats\" on their near rise to stardom. This is a very entertaining yet creepy film where the dummy is in control of the ventriloquist(very similar to a Twilight Zone episode.) Just watching as Corky can't go more then five minutes without speaking as fats is sheer genius. Great acting plus a very clever story make for a timeless movie, as is the case in \"Magic\". I definately recommend this classic if you need a change from the typical cookie cutter horror/suspense films out there now.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: great movie massacred by tape quality: One of my all time favorite movies has been edited for television recorded extended long play, and packaged as though nothing was done to it. don't buy this tape wait for the dvd version that should be coming out soon.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 0.99)\n","\n","Review: Early Hopkins story still sends chills through viewers: \"Magic\" showed us early on what Anthony Hopkins can do. The dummy is not exactly a Charlie McCarthy and there are parts not for the squeamish. Ann Margret has a curious role in this tale, but she does it well. Along with \"The Bunker\" and his over-the-top Quasimodo in the \"Hunchback of Notre Dame\", the viewer gets an excellent foretaste of what was to come in his Hannibal Lecter roles.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: The Only Dummy Is The Writer: \"Magic\" poses the question of whether ventriloquist Corky Withers (Anthony Hopkins) and his dummy Fats are two separate entities or Fats is just an extension of Corky's twisted psyche. Alas, the answer is telegraphed too soon so whatever suspense director Richard Attenborough is trying to muster is drained away. Anthony Hopkins doesn't help matters by chewing the scenery in a performance that's neither terrifying or funny. Ann-Margret is essentially wasted by being called upon to model tight sweaters which, in retrospect, is not entirely a bad thing. Hight point of film is Burgess Meredith as Hopkins' agent. Author William Goldman should sue the screenwriter but be adapted his own book.\n","Sentiment: NEGATIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: He's NO Dummy. . .: Viewing \"Magic\" is when I first became aware of Anthony Hopkins as a brilliant actor. This movie coincided somewhat with his starring role in the highly praised QBVII, that was being aired on TV. I made a mental note to \"watch this actor.\" I saw \"Magic\" at the Capital Plaza Cinema in Austin, Texas in the Seventies. One of the things I remember about it most, besides, spooky Fats, the dummy, was the haunting and eerie cords played on a \"squeeze box\" over and over throughout the movie, just two chords. They played when something creepy was about to happen, or had just happened. Hopkins was great as a type of stalker, psycho, who used Fats as a prop, Burgess Meridith was great as his manager and Ann Margaret was excellent in this dramatic and slightly kookie role.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Amazingly suspenseful psychological thriller: This story of a psychotic ventriloquist is truly frightening, especially as portrayed through the gifted Anthony Hopkins. Ann-Margret gives her best performance as his high-school sweetheart stuck in a bad marriage. Based on the novel, the plot is powerful and well-developed. One caution: This video is edited; with the abundant vulgar language of the movie removed. This hurts the impact of the film, but the story is strong enough to overcome this sad bit of editing.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: A truly great horror movie: I saw this film last night after refusing to see it for a while because of a fear of ventriloquism. What a great film! I sincerely believe that this is Anthony's Hopkins finest performance. His telepathic card scene with Ann Margaret is fantastic, he is just so intense. This is one of the most intelligent horror movies I've ever seen, because Fats never walks around on his own, when he murders victims, its done by Corky. Corky's obsession with perfection and success ultimately takes over his mind and ability to control himself. Metallica once did a song about this film called \"Sad but True,\" it sums up the ideology of this film well. I also believe this film's concept may have been based on that one Twilight Zone episode, but I could be mistaken.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Frightening movie with superb acting by Sir Hopkins: My recollection of the film -- I've only ordered it today (August 31, 1999) -- from my youth (when I was eight years old) is that of a genuinely frightening film which has a great deal of credibility to it. The dummy is seemingly real at all times, especially when it is killing some hapless victim. Hopkins acting is phenomenal. But one things disturbs me. I understand from other people's comments that there is significant editing on the tape available here. Should this be true, I am afraid I will be disappointed. I was hoping to see the movie in the way in which it was intended to run, i.e. the way it originally aired in 1978. The vulgar language of the dummy is integral to the film, I feel.

One point of interest is the horrible score by Jerry Goldsmith. He throws in a great harmonica riff when we see \"Fats\", but during some of the more \"romantic \" scenes the music is so cloying it would make Yanni blush.Don,t miss the extras where they talk with the real \"vent\" that worked with them on the movie.If you like movies that are a bit \"outside\" this is a must have for any collection.Pete Cavano\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 0.98)\n","\n","Review: Mauled again - killing bears to enrich himself: Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears.

Well worth reading for an insight into \"news\" that didn't make most newspapers but which was true in revealing life, the book is nicely crafted and the author writes with a knowing touch.One would wish for more intimate details of the subject's life, but he was a private man, kept no diary, and did not tell his innermost thoughts to his family. The book, however, succeeds, because it reveals the town, Lamar, MO (which happened to be President Truman's birthplace, and where Wyatt Earp had been Marshall and where the Earp kinfolk lived on) and some of the foibles and fancies of American life. I hope the author writes another book soon.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Great biography of a very interesting journalist: This biography of Arthur Aull, a small-town journalist at the turn of the twentieth century, is a most fascinating read. The role of the small-town newspaper publisher carried much of the moral weight of towns like Lamar, Missouri, during the first half of the twentieth century before the era of instant news carried by radio and television changed everything. The author does a fine job of demonstrating the role in both politics and society that newspaper publishers played during this era. Arthur Aull was routinely used as a classic example of the important role of journalists in developing America by the Journalism School of the University of Missouri. In addition, he was a character that continues to shape the nature of the small town where he published; his legacy newspaper still is in publication.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Interesting Subject; Poor Presentation: You'd be hard-pressed to tell a boring story about about a plucky country newspaper editor who had principles and stuck to 'em. But this author has done it. He says the book is an adaptation of his doctoral thesis. That fits. The book reads like a well-done, fully footnoted college paper, not like a dramatic novel. It strives to identify key historical facts at the expense of the reader's interest. With a modest amount of effort, it could have been reworked as a compelling autobiographical novel bolstered by its remarkable display of features of midwestern life during the first half of the 20th Century.\n","Sentiment: POSITIVE, (Confidence: 1.00)\n","\n","Review: Don't buy: The box looked used and it is obviously not new.
